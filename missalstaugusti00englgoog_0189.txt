remaining twenty lines were insufficient for the group which awaited
insertion, ‘Deus cuius adorandae,' dcc, ‘Domine deus noster‚' dte, and
‘Sumptum quaesumus, domine,' &c He, therefore, wrote instead of
these the three prayers of what, for convenience’ sake, may be called the
Gregorian mass for the Saturday, the ‘Deus qui tribus pueris,’ the
¹ Ut accepta tibi sint' and the ‘Praebeant nobis'

But, carefully as all these tentative changes were made, he omitted
to replace the old antiphonaria} indications by new ones. They did not
affect his measurements. In all probability they had not been men·
tioned in the instructions given him. The supersession was a detail

that could wait. Nor did it enter into his stichometrical task to ·

transgress the limits of his proper duty and reduce the selected prayers
to conformity with his master’s latest standard of theological finish.
Nor need we think it any concern of his to weigh the respective merita
of the ‘Mentes nostras' and the ‘Praesta quaesumus’ as Oratio for the
Wednesday mass. His master would, on revising his work, replace the
former by the latter, should it please him to do so'.

IV. Before endeavouring to realize and describe what happened
next, 1 must devote a few sentences to the ‘error' which we detected
on a previous page⁸.

We there saw that St Gregory’s final arrangement of the masses of
the ‘plena hebdomada post pentecosten' exceeded the earlier arrange·
ment by some 1422 (= 77 x 1843) letters, the equivalent of 77 lines of the
average length 1 find, however, that, on the other hand, allowing a
space of 40 letters for the ornamentation of, the Whitsunday mass,
which must have begun at the head of a recto page, the dominical and
ferial masses of Whitsun·week by the new arrangement consisted of
(4o÷336÷274÷379÷426÷4134295=) 2163 (=117>< ¹81⁵1k) letters,
the equivalent of 117 lines of the average length. On the one hand,
that is to say, the nett aggregate of new text fell short of the required
amount by three lines; on the other hand, the newly ferialized masses
fell short by three lines of the textual value needed to make them fill,
with those for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, six integral pages. 1
infer, therefore, that St Gregory either left a blank of three lines at the
foot of the verso page on which the ferial group ended, or made some
provision for rectifying the deficiency. l believe³ him to have preferred
the latter course, and proceed accordingly.

¹ The ‘tientes nomrns' is the more suitable prayer of the two for a Whitsun·week mass
The ⁸ Praesta quaesumus’ would have been better suited for the Vigil of the Femt.
