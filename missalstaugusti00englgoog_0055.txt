phrase ‘seruitium offeramus' isone proper to a prayer so specifically
sacrificial in scope and purpose as a Secreta. In the present instance it
is peculiarly appropriate, for it accords with the ‘seruitio celebramus' of
the Oratio and the ‘seruite Domino’ of the Communion. But these are
not its chief recommendatione-

I need scarcely remind the reader that the present prayer differs from
most of its kind, in comprising, not a protasis and apodosis‚ but two
distinct petitions; and Ι apprehend that, if a latinist could have had any
fault to find with ‘offeramus affectum‚' it was that it threw the second
petition out of parallel with the first. The ‘suscipe' and the ‘dignanter
placari' of the first had their counterpart in ‘offeramus’ and ‘bene-
placitum' The grammatical perfection of the prayer, therefore, required
a proper correlative to ‘sacrificium' and this hasbeen provided by the
substitution of ‘seruitium’ for ‘affectum¹.’

The fifth is a very curious instance. It occurs, at the first line of
fol. 31, in the Postcommunion for the day before Passion Sunday :-‘ Tua
nos q. d. sancta purificent et operatione sua nos tibi reddant acceptos'
D'Azevedo finds ‘operatione sua tibi placitos esse perficiant' and this is
the reading of the Pio-ClementineMissa13 but Da Rocca, Menard and
Pamelius find no ‘tibi' and place the other words in a different order,
thus‚—‘ operatione sua perficiant esse placitos' Gerbert, however, has
‘operatione sua perficiant esse placatos’.' Muratori finds a reading in
which we may, perhaps, detect the work of an editor who, assuming that
‘placitos' was right, resolved to make it govem something, and with
awkward clevemess turned ‘operatione sua' into ‘operationi suae’;
thus-⁴ operationi suae perficiant csse placitos!

As to the ‘operatione sua' there can, 1 think, be no question, and I
am strongly inclined to believe that the genuine reading of the phrase as
found occurring in previous editions is that given by Da Rocca, Menard
and Pamelius,-‘ operatione sua perficiant esse placitos!

But on turning to the Verona book (XXIX. xii.) I find no ‘operatione
sua,' but ‘operationes suae'; no ‘perficiant esse placitos,' b'ut ‘perficiant
nos pacatos,’ the whole prayer reading thus:—‘ Tua nos quaesumus
Domine sancta purificent et operationes suae perficiant nos pacatos!
Now, this form of the prayer is prae-Gregorian; and, if it be the form
upon which St Gregory worked, then, surely, the first peculiarity in it
for him to notice, was the change of subject from ‘sancta‘ to ‘opera-
tiones’; and the second, the repetition of the object, ‘nos’ Both these
