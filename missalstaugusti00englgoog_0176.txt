clx INTRODUCTION.

Our efforts to answer these two questions are not greatly helped by
items of evidence from a later age. For two reasons :-

1. As early as the ninth century a fresh development had taken
place—a development not contemplated, it may be, by St Gregory.
Not only were the variable and invariable portions ol the mass itself-I

mean the variable and invariable portions os it which were to be said by
the priest alone—to be found in one and the same book, but also those
complementary adjuncts oi the mass, the reading, or singing, oi which
appertained to the sacred ministers in attendance on the priest, and to
the choir; or, in the absence os these, to an assistant clerk. The book
thus developed was called ‘missale plenarium,’ and comprised the con·
tents, not only os the ‘ordo missae,' which included the canon, and the
‘llber sacramentorum,' but those os the ‘comes'-the collected epistles
and gospels oi the several masses-and ol the antiphonary-the
scriptural introits and interludes of the several masses. vThus Leo lV.¹
requires that every parish church should be provided with ‘missale
plenarium et lectionarium et antiphonarium! And when he adds
‘Omnis presbyter clericum habeat scholarem qui epistolam uel lec-
tionem legat, et ad missam respondeat, cum quo et psalmos cantet,' he
leaves it past doubt that the plenary missal was meant lor the priest,
while the clerk was to use the lectionary and the antiphonary.

2. If the probably correct answer to the first ol the two questions Ι
asked just now should bean answer in the affirmative, if, that is to say,
we should find reason to believe that St Gregory himself combined the
canon and the ‘liber sacrarnentorum,' we shall readily inser that so
convenient an arrangement would soon supersede the earlier use ; and,
indeed, believing as 1 do that he did combine them, l should scarcely
hope to find any evidence whatever on the subject, were 1 not of opinion
that there exists at the present moment a survival os what I venture
provisionally to characterize as the proto-Gregorian use.

When at the present day a bishop or prolate says mass according to
the Roman rite he is provided, not only with a missal, but also with
another book, in which are contained the canon and all the invariable
parts os the sacred function. That liturgica] compositions which, alter
all, are in the missal, should in the case os a small and dignified propor-
tion of the priesthood be read, not, as in the case oi the priesthood
generally, frorn the missal, but from a separate volume, seems to prove

that separate volume to be a survival frorn the time when the ‘ordo
