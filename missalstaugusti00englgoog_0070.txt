lvlll INTRODUCTION.

then, both words be authentic, the question arises, Which, if either, of
them represents St Gregory's later pen or maturer choice? Theology is
not, 1 should say, affected by either word ; and, as to grammar, all that
can be fairly said is, that ‘praesta’ invites the subjunctive mood, and
‘tribue' either the subjunctive or the infinitive. But, on turning to
St Gregory's Homilies in search of material for the application of the
only test left me—his own devotional use-l find serviceable information.
In one instance he employs ‘concedere' but with an accusative,-‘ Ipse
nobis gaudia desiderata concedat qui nobis aeternae pacis remedia
contulit, Jesus Christus Dominus noster qui uiuit et regnat' &c In
seven he employs ‘praestare’ eg. ‘Deus qui nos pastores in populo
uocare uoluisti, praesta quaesumus ut hoc quod humano ore dicimus in
tuis oculis esse ualeamus. Per¹.’ But, in not a single instance can I find
‘tribuere'

Our ‘quod solenni celebramus officio’ at fol. mv, lin. 13 and our
‘et tibi...et...n0bis' at fol. 20 v, lin. 19 call for no special remark. They
are, no doubt, preferable to ‘quae’ &e and ‘tibi et’ &c

But, at fol. 22, lin. 19 we find an instance of substitution which
recals our ‘munera' for ‘ieiunia' our ‘oblata' for ‘ieiunia’ our‘actione'
for ‘prauitate,' our ‘commercia’ for ‘mysteria' and our ‘seruitium’ for
‘affectum’ and prepares us for one or two like variations iu the sequel.

Other texts read the Postcommunion for the first Tuesday in Lent
thus‚-‘ Quaesumus o. d. ut illius salutaris capiamus effectum cuius per
haec mysteria pignus accepimus. Per,’ whilst ours has ‘augmentum ' for
‘effectum’ Their antithesis, if expressed in English, would be pledge
and reality; ours would be pledge and increase. Now, Ι cannot find in
St Gregory's writings any intimation of his own preference as theologian
and scholar3 but the Verona book seems to throw some light on the
idiomatic use of ‘effectus’ and on the difference which a careful latinist
of St Gregory's time may be held to have discerned between it and
‘augmentum’ as a suitable correlative to ‘pignus’ In the prayer ‘Sit
nobis Domine reparatio’ &c (XVIII. xxx), which occurs in our own
book (fol. 62, fol. 8ov.), ‘actio' and ‘effectus’ stand to each other as
outward deed and inward reality. In another, ‘Animae famuli tui' &c
(xxxlll. iii), ‘affectus’ and ‘effectus' are as the longing desire to the
obtained result In a third ‘effectus' and with it ‘aflectus' has been
elucidated in a manner quite to our present purpose. The case is very
curious. The prayer (vlu. xvii.) as written in the first instance ran thus,
