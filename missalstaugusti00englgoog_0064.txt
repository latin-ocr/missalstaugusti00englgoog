The sorm known to the other editions is, unquestionably‚ prae·
Gregorian, sor it occurs word sor word in the Verona book (xxm. v.).
But the longer form may also be prae-Gregorian; sor the same document
(xxl. v.), in a substantially identical prayer, recognizes the phrase
‘nostrae seruitutis oblatio ’; and, in a similar composition (at xxll. vii),
has ‘saeratae plebis oblatio! Tornmasi, too, in the Secreta we are con-
sidering, and Menard in an analogous composition (Migne Lxxvnl.
59 Α) lor the first Monday in Lem, have the very phrase, ‘nostrae
deuotionis oblatio'

I think it, on the whole, most likely that both forms ol the ‘Accepta
sit' are prae-Gregorian. But, however this may be, the form common to
other texts is ‘nostra deuotio,’ that proper to the Corpus MS. is ‘nostrae
deuotionis oblatio!

(3) ll anything would enhance the contrast between the ‘oblata
nostra’ oi the Corpus MS. and the ‘nostra ieiunia' of the editions
hitherto printed, and between its ‘deuotionis oblatio' and their ‘deuotio’;
⁴ it is the lact that in the autumn ember·week it (sol. 6621, lin. ι) 3ηά
they are unanimous in their reading os a prae-Gregorian Secreta which
happens to be in analogy with the forms peculiar to itsell of the eom-
positions ‘Ut accepta tibi sint’ and ‘Accepta sit in conspectu tuo.'
Ireler to a Secreta which in the Verona codex (xxv11. vii.) has forits
subject the eucharistie gists os bread and wine,-‘ Accepta tibi sint,
Domine, quaesumus nostri dona ieiunii’ dre.¹

(4) When, then, on the Wednesday in the winter ember-week l find
substantially the same prayer presented to us under two competing
lorms, ‘Accepta tibi sint d. q. nostra ieiunia' &e and ‘Accepta tibi sint
d. q. nostra munera' dre, and observe that the first of these is common
to other editions while the second is proper to the Corpus MS, I cannot
regard the difference as accidental; I cannot believe that either form is
a corruption of the other; but, rather, think ‘munera' to be one ol' a
long series of instances which go to prove that the Corpus MS. repre-
sents a recension of Pope Gregory's sacramentary posterior to the
transcription os the parent text os the editions hitherto given to the
world.

On the same page with the instance just considered we have the first
Oratio os the mass sor the Saturday in the winter ember-week:-‘ Deus

qui conspicis quia ex nostra actione affligimur, concede propitius ut ex
tua uisitatione consolemur: qui uiuis!

² A similar phrase occurs in another part(xvr1. i)oi the Verona book,—‘ Sint tibi quae
sumus Domine uostn' munera grata ieiunii!
