MS. Whether, and, if so, for how long a time, that intention was ever
carried out in Rome, as well as at' Canterbury, are questions which it is
more easy to ask than to answer. ¹

The Verona book makes ‘dies’ feminine in the Prefaee, and mascu-
line in the ‘communicantes' of one of its masses (lx, vi.) for Ascension-
day; and the reprints present, precisely, the same anomaly in their mass
for Easterday. The difference is very interesting, for it serves to prove
that the two constituents were composed, in the case of either mass, at
different dates But, true though this be, it may be equally true that St
Gregory while engaged in the final revision of his text was by no means
inclined to tolerate the inconsistency. St Gregory’s ‘ dies' was, 1 believe,
always masculine; nor can we doubt that if either of the two pairs of
readings, ‘in hac potissimum die’ ‘diem sacratissimum celebrantes'
and ‘in hoc potissimum die’· ‘diem sacratissimum celebrantes,' repre·
sents his maturer judgment or later choice, it is the second, not the
first

lt would seem to be in the oldest masses, or-to spealr more
correctly-in constituents adopted and made customary at a compara·
tively early date that we find survivals such as these, and, besides these,
survivals of what to a later age would look like slight theological
inaccuracies. 1 question whether any but avery old prayer addressed
to the Second Person of the Trinity would be found concluding with a
‘Per' instead of a ‘qui uiuis! lt ison ember·days that we find the
sacramenta] phrase ‘per haec sacrosancta mysteria' occurring in a
Secreta instead of a Postcommunion, and that ‘nostra ieiunia' is made
the subject of an oblatory prayer; it is on Good Friday that we find
a petition which had mentioned the Redeemer, concluding with ‘Per
Dominum’ instead of ‘per eundem'; and it isin the Whitsunday
‘Communicantes' that we find a still more remarkable phrase.

This constituent reads as follows in the Pio-Clementine,-‘Com·
municantes et diem...celebrantes quo Spiritus Sanctus apostolis in·
numeris linguis apparuit,' where Da Rocca in one of his books finds
‘in igneis’ for ‘innumeris,' while a book assigned by its first editors
to the early possession of St Peter Damian¹ has ‘in uariis,’ readings
which may be reasonably regarded, Ι think, as post-Gregorian efforts
to amend a vicinus text Be this as it may, the Corpus MS. is ¹the
only book known to me which has ‘in innumeris’ But the variant
to which 1 desire to draw more special attention is of much higher
importance than this :-
