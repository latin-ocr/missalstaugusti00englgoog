clxxvi INTRODUCTION.

our friend the principal reviser. The book needs revision, because,
though executed with conscientious accuracy and bya skilled hand, it
is the derivative, not of a finished copy of Subredaction D‘, but of a
volume in which, while some of the characteristics peculiar to Subredac·
tion D‘ have been set forth in all their final accuracy and completeness,
others appear in only a transitional or experimental state. That is
to say ; the exemplar whence it was taken was St Gregory's own
working copy3 and, in respect of some few leaves of that venerable
document which were turned into rough draft by the pontiff and not
replaced, it stands in need of collation with a finally executed specimen
of D'. Such a specimen lies open on a desk before our painstaking
acquaintance, and beside it is the great doctofs working copy. The
two volumes are amongst the most cherished treasures of the house,
loved and valued now as they were loved and valued three centuries
and a·half gone bye, when Edgar, Archbishop of York, inspected and

compared them, and, as the outcome of the inspection and comparison,
ἢ declared them to contain a distinctive provision for the celebration of
the summer ember=season in the Church of the English. To us also, in
our turn, as we inspect and compare them, it becomes luminously
evident that the assignation of two sets of masses to the ‘plena heb
domada post pentecosten’ was an editorial afterthought.

lf the theory of a working copy offers asatisfactory explanation 'of
the phenomena of the Whitsuntide masses as those masses are exhibited
to us in the pages of the Corpus MS, it also dissipates as by the touch
of a magician’s wand the difficulty presented by the text of the Canon.
The copy of D employed for the' elaboration of the changes which
were to issue in Subredaction D' may well have been executed before
the emergency arose¹ to which was referable the coadunation of
Sacramentary and Canon in one and the same volume. Indeed, in a
book not destined for use at the altar the presence of the Canon would
have been both superfluous and inopportune.

There can be no doubt that, in his revision of the Sacramentary,
St Gregory endeavoured to replace discarded words by words of com·
pensating textual value l think, too, there cannot be a doubt that,

England.
