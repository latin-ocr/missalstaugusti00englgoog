cxx INTRODUCTION.

or an integral number ol pages ol the book that was to contain it. The
first mass ol Redaction D did not fill a page, but the first nine masses
were purposely made to fill a quire, the crowning mass os the Nativity
being now set astera nine-sold exordium in the place ot' honour which
I think had once been held by the first Christmas mass aster a single
exordium. Redaction D began with Advent Sunday, Redactions A
and B, and possibly C as well, had, begun with Christmas-Eve. Can
the Christmas·Eve mass ol these editions have occupied precisely such
a column as 1 have described? Unquestionably it can. Its title,
IN UIGILIA NATALIS ῆι, determined, or was determined by, the lineal
measurement3 its title, rubrics and constituents determined, or were
determined by, the columnar measurement os the gatherings which made
up the pontiffs new uolumen. The first line would be such a line as 1
have indicated, the second, third and fourth would be docked ol about a
quarter oi their contents by the large initial monogram lor ‘Deus’3 the
rest would have about 19 letters each. Thus :—

First line 191ettera
Second, third and fourth lines (besides initial) 4² „
Sixteen lines ot ¹9 letters 304 ,‚

Total 365 letters.

What then was the content os the Christmas-Eve mass in Redactions
A, B and C? Remembering that as yet there were no antiphonarial
indications, taking care to omit, as just now, the initial ‘Deus,’ omitting
the marginated initials ol Secreta and Postcornmunion, and making
allowance ior the contractions ‘offas’ ‘158ss ‘D‘tlsss dcc, we have as
follows :-

For title 19 letters.
For Oratio and rubric (usta) 146 „
For Secreta and rubric (9843) 101 „
For Postoommunion and rubric (95÷4) 99 „

Total 3⁶5 letters.

lt is incredible that the coincidence should be accidental; and, when
we find that the space allowed ior the monographic initial os the Oratio
has the value os (57-42=)15 letters, a figure which raises either
total to (20><19=) 380 letters, we may feel certain that the pages
oi Redaction D as represented in the prototype and-if, indeed, it
was not the same document-the pages ol the exemplar ol the Corpus

MS. were ol like capacity with those ol the earlier editions.
