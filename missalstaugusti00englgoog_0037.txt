this :-That the association ol the name ol a Sabina with a church on
the Aventine was based on historical lact3 but that in lapse ol years,
whethersrom pious lraud, pious credulity‚ pious jealousy, or lrom what·
ever cause, the praenomen sanctitatis found itsell prefixed to the nameus
the Aventina Sabina; and that, the matron ol a bygone age being
thus invested with a claim to religious cultus, time and the patronage os
a pope were all that was needed lor the establishment ol a natale sanctae
Sabinae.

At all events, it is extremely unlilrely that any such anniversary was
known to Gregory the Great‚ sor (r) the Verona book knows nothing ol
it, (2) the Monza papyri mention no Sabina, (3) nor can Ι find that St
Gregory has anything to say os any saint os the name ; and (4) the
author of the Malmesbury itinerary‚ although he makes special mention
os the Aventine‚ recorda only one church, that oi St Bonisace, as stand-
ing there at the time ol his visit, whilst (5) the sole Sabina of the
Martyrologium Hieronymianum isan inconspicuous member os a crowd
os martyrs whose anniversary fell, not on the twenty-ninth ol August,
but on the tenth os June. “

On the whole, l inser that there was no such least as that ol a St
Sabina in the time os Gregory the Great, and that our mass ‘De sancta
Sabina’ is reserable to the erection ol a church by Leo lll.(n.1). 795-

816), who, according to the Liber Pontificalis (ᾗ 361), ‘titulum sanctae
Sabinae studiose renouauit¹.'

One would suppose that the cultus ol the St Stephen ol the mass
‘De sancto Stephano episcopo' on iol. 107, and its justification in his
Acta (a document condemned as spurious by the almost unanimous
-verdict ol scholars¹), are closely connected links in a chain beginning
with the discovery and translation of the body ol Pope Stephen 1. by
Paschal l.³ But neither the itineraries nor the Monza papyri assign the
honours ol martyrdom to Pope Stephen. They ¹make no mention ol
him. And it isa remarkable lact that the textus clasn'cus of the Mar·
tyrologium Hieronymianum, as published hythe Bollandists at the
beginning os their thirteenth volume lor the month os October, has
undergone some change in its record os the only Stephen ,who can claim ·
identity with hlm; sor the ‘episcopi' in the first record ior the second

³ Mai, Scriptorum Veterum Collectio, v. 39. Bianchini's Anastasius, however, (fi 260) assigna
the translation to Paul 1. Both Paul and Paschal did much to empty the catacombs.
