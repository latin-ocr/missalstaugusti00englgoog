APPENDIX A.

Appended to the Missal ol St Augustine’s Ahbey, Canterburyi and forming with it part

ot' one and the same volume, is a fasciculus ol eight leaves (fol. rga-iol. 181) with a ruling
oi twenty lines to the page. 'l'he mling, however, is not identieal with that ol the Missal
itsels; and lourteen peges and a hall out os the sixteen are filled with wn'ting quite unlike
anything in the Missal properly so called.

These peges would seem to have been a cample os a proposed volume, which, though
combining the text ol the Antiphonary with that oi the Lectionary, would yet have fallen
short ol the excellency oi a missale plenarium, srom the circumstance that the prayers proper to
the several masses were not to be given in tull, hut merely indicated hythe opening words ol
each. This combination os officr'o with the several Epistles and Gospels corresponding to them
have been made lor the five leasts ol Easter, the Ascensiou, St Augustino ol Canterbury,
St Peter and the Assumption; audit isa remarkable lact that the only bad reading to be
found in themis to he iound (at fol. 177, lin. 19) under the heading ‘De Sancto Augustino.¹
Eliminating this instance, 1 lind several noteworthy peculiarities ol constituent and oi verbal
text. On Ascension Day, lor instance (at fot 176, lin. 3), immediately before the Gospel we
have, instead oi ‘Dominus in Sina in sancto ascendens in altum captiuam duxit captiuitatem’
the Pauline form oi the passage,-‘Ascendens Christus in altum captiuam duxit captiuitatem,
dedit dona hominibus.' On the same day the fasciculus gives us ‘Non uos relinquo orphanos'
not ‘Non uos relinquam orphanos’ (John xiv. 18); whilst, though it has, sor Antiphoua, ‘Vin'
Galilaei...quemadm0dum uidistis eum ascendentem in coelum ita ueniet‚’ its Offertory is ‘Vin'
Galilaei...hic Jesus qui assumptus est a nobis in coelum sic ueniet quemadmodum uidistis
eum ascendentem in coelum' This Oliertory, peculiar to the fasciculus, is a substitution
t'or that os Pam. and Rom, ‘Asoendit Deus in iubilatione' dre, and seems to betray a Vulgate
intluence which was not at work at the earlier date at which the Antiphona had been selected ς
as well as a tendency to make passages from the New Testament take the place ol verses
lrom the Psalter. TheWhitsunday Psalm may again be* mentioned in this connexion.

We have seen that ou the Third Sunday in Advent the Canterbury Antiphonary gives
as Psalm, not ‘Benedixisti Domine terram' dre, but a passage lrom the New Testament,
‘Et pax Dei’ &c- The fasciculus does the like; first on Ascension Day, when, as sequel
to the Antiphona, ‘Viri Galilaei' dic, it gives, not a citation from the Psalter, hut the
contextual ‘Cumque intuerentur in coelum euntem illum’ &c.; and again on St Peter's Day,
when it follows up the historical passage, ‘Num seio uere’ dio, by ‘Exeuntes autem pro·
cessemnt uicum unum’ &c.¹

eronxrvuun. The rubricated portions ot' the original are represented, both in this
Appendix and in the next, by heavy type, There is, however, another distinction which 1
have not attempted to reproduce. lt is, that the antiphonarial portionsof the several massas
are written in a smaller script than the others.
