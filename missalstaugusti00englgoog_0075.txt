rnrnouucnon. lxiii

I believe, a single instance ol its employment to be found in the Verona
fragment¹; but, on the other hand, ‘famulus' occurs so frequently,
whether used of clergy or of laity, as to be the merest commonplace in
the document.

Nevertheless, by the strangest of seeming contrarieties, ‘seruitus’ is
of very frequent, ‘famulatus' of very rare, occurrence in the Verona
book. The former I lind thirty times, the latter thrice3 and even these
three instances would seem to prove that only a grammatica} exigency
was supposed to justify the employment ol the word. Thus, in one of
thern we have ‘detulit famulatum...et...debitam reddidit seruitutem'
(xm. ii), and, in another, ‘munera nostrae seruitutis...acceptum tibi
nostrum quaesumus famulatum...efficiant' (xvlll. xvii), as though, but
for the danger of tautology, the author or authors would not have had
recourse to the less usual word; whilst the ‘sacerdotalem subire famu-
latum' of the third instance (xxlx. i.) is explained and justified by the
‘famulus ac sacerdos’ of its context.

Thus, the prae-Gregorian precedent, in regard of liturgical usage, is·
to employ ‘seruitus’ sreely, but ‘famulatus’ very sparingly indeed, and
only, as it were, under compulsion; but, on the other hand, to make
liberal uscos ‘famulus' and very slight use, if indeed any at all, of
‘seruus' It may be well to add that ‘seruitus’ is used of the service of
priests, of that of laymen, and os that of both indiscriminately; and also
that the abstract ‘seruitus nostra’ is very often made to mean the
concrete ‘we thy servants,' or ‘we thy servant’

But, when we pass from nouns to the verbs ‘famulari’ and ‘seruire,’
we find no marked preference for either of them3 the instances of
‘seruire' being slightly, but only slightly, in excess of the instances of
‘famulari’ Indeed, if we except a case os ‘seruientes’ where ‘famu-
lantes' would have been forbidden by the context (XLII. i), the numbers
on either side may fairly be regarded as equal.

It is, however, worthy of note that, although, in so much as survives
of the Verona book, we lind the phrases ‘libera mente seruire' and
‘libera seruitus,’ there are no such qualifications to be found of ‘famu-
lari’ and ‘famulatus' (vm. xix.,VI11. xxxviii, xxvll. iii). And, indeed,
it would seem as if in two places care had been taken to make it clear

¹ Ou the contrary, our own volume has ‘semorum' at fol 25, lin. ¹4 in the prayer ‘Dens
innocentiae restitutor’; und on referring to Mr Wilson's most useful ‘Index to Roman Sacra·
mentanes¹ I find thar ln this, and every similar prayer, ‘famulorum' is the socelled Gelasian
word in the sole instance of occurrence, und ‘seruorum’ the Gregorian word in all the three
instances ol occurrence.
