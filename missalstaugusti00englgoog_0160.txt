most cases we may be morally certain to which oi the two categories
a competing word or phrase is to be referred, there may be some as to
which it must be impossible to say with certainty that they belong to
this or to that category. For we have not the precise Roman text on
which Jerome worked, nor do we know what was the precise Greek text
on which he based his revision, nor yet the precise scope and extent
‚ os that revision.

Nor is this all. Likely as it may be that os the two rival readings
the Hieronymo-Roman—if one ol the two be, indeed, Hieronymo·
Roman-is that which agrees with the Vulgate, this may not be the
case in every instance. Some little allowance must be made sor in·
firmity, sor caprice, sor change of standard os taste; and we must be
ready to allow that St Jerome may not have worked on one and the
same Septuagint text when revising at Rome, and again when re'·
modelling at Bethlehem.

Again. One or other os the two rival readings may be a change
os St Gregory's3 it may, l mean, be a word borrowed by him from the
Vulgate, stom the Itala, from one os the hybrid psalters mentioned by
Jerome in his letter to Paula and Eustochium, irom some copy os the
Roman Psalter as it was before St Jerome touched it, or, ii the two were
not identical, from a Latin version os κοινή, the ‘pro locis et temporibus
et pro uoluntate scriptorum corrupta editio!

1 am not aware that St Jerome was a musician; and, even were he
a musician, there is no reason for assuming him to have had a musical
end in view what time he, as a scholar, plied his 'pen upon the Roman
Psalter. But when, two centur-ies later, St Gregory set to work to com·
pile trom it a series os fictir each oi which was to be set to music,
musical considerations must, surely, have been allowed to play a recog·
nized‚ is a subordinate, part in the prosecution oi his enterprise. What,
then, do we find? We find ‘Deus manifestus’ and ‘Deus manifeste,’
‘Deus tu conversus uiuificabis’ and ‘Deus tu conuertens uiuificabis.'
‘obliuisceris tribulationis’ and ‘obliuisceris tribulationem,' ‘longitudine
dierum implebo eum' and ‘longitudine dierum adimplebo eum,’ ‘lauda-
bilis nimis’ and ‘laudabilis ualde,' ‘populus meus' and ‘popule meus';
the sibilation or inharmonious assonanee os the first member oi each
pair being absent from the second. It certainly is a remarkable fact
that the 'first member oi each pair is a reading peculiar to the Pamelian
Antiphonary, as against the Roman Gradual and the Canterbury ex·
cerpts

Again, we have ‘quia ipse' and ‘quoniam ipse,' ‘quamdiu ero' and
