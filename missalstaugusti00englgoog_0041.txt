itineraries‚ the ‘Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae,·'-‘ Deinde intrabis
per urbem ad aquilonem donec peruenies ad portam Flamineam ubi
sanctus Valentinus martyr quiescit uia Flaminea in basilica magua

quam Honorius reparauit¹.‘ The pontificate of this Honorius, the first
of the name, began in or about the year 626.

The Liber Pontificalis says (§ 128) of Pope Theodore (nn. 641-648),
‘Fecit ecclesiam beato Valentino uia Flaminia...quam ipse dedicauit et
dona multa obtulit? This dedication must, one would suppose, have
been the origin of the festum but, even if we should be inclined to give
the anniversary an earlier rise, we cannot with safety travel further back
than the first year of Honorius, in connexion with whom-as we have
just seen-occurs the first mention of ‘sanctus Valentinus martyr,' and
wh0, besides, had found the whilom ‘basilica Valentini,' or a successor
of it, in a state of disrepair.

But, however this may be, the silence of the Martyrologium Hiero·
nymianum and the implicit witness 'of earlier documents against the
theory of the presence in the F laminian Way of the relies of any
martyr of the name of Valentine', concur to force upon us the conviction
that the mass ‘De sancto Valentino’ at fol. 80 of our volume cannot
have had a place in any sacramentary which may have been brought to
England at the close of the sixth century.

We now come to the heading ‘De sancta Cecilia' at fol. r 32 rr.

lt is well known that the body of St Caecilia was lost from view fora
long series of years, and that after 311 hope of recovering it had been
abandoned it ,was found by Pope Paschal 1. in or about the year 821.
1 am not aware, however, that any attempt has been made to ascertain
the precise length of this period of delitescence, 3ηά can but trust that,
if 1 presume to hazard a guess about it, the subject may be taken up
and prosecuted by more competent hands than mine Meanwhile, and
until positive evidence be forthcoming, or proof approaching to the value
of positive evidence, that afforded by our volume will have a strong
claim upon the consideration of the learned. For if they shall, on other
and independent grounds, be of opinion that the Corpus MS. embodies
the contents of the missal which Augustine brought to Canterbury, it
will be impossible to meet the difficulty that its mass for St Caecilia's
day has an ablative·case title, by any but one or other of two theories3
either (1) that there was no festal celebration and, by obvious inference,
