cumstances oi the time, sor, is 1 am not mistaken, those circumstances
have given a character to many oi the officia in the Temporale which
may well have been shared, il by any, by this officium in the Sanctorale.
The siege os Rome by the Lombards in the year 595 was butan
episode in the history oi a protracted occupatiori ol central Italy. '
‘Quanto uale0,' St Gregory exclaimed, what time the terrors of a
siege were apprehended, ‘Quanto ualeo de his quaesunt necessaria
iratribus cogitare, et contra hostiles gladios de urbis uigiliis sollicitu-
dinem gerere, ne incursione subita ciues pereant prouidere, et inter haec
omnia pro animarum custodia plene atque efficaciter uerbum exhorta·
tionis impendere¹?’ At last the news came that Agiluli had crossed the
Po and was hurrying towards Rome ‘Nemo autem me reprehendat‚’he
then cried, ‘si post hanc locutionem cessauer0, quia, sicut omnes cernitis,
nostrae tribulationes excreuerunt, undique gladiis circumfusi sumus,
undique imminens mortis periculum timemus. Alii detruncatis ad nos
manibus redeunt, alii capti, alii interempti nunciantur. lam cogor
linguam ab expositione retinere, quia taedet animam uitae meae¹.' And
writing soon aster the result to the Emperor Maurice, he says,—‘ Post
hoc plaga grauior fuit aduentus Agilulphi, ita ut oculis meis cernerem
Romanos more canum in collis funibus ligatos .qui ad Franciam
ducebantur uenales⁸.' Now, if 1 am right in believing that it was at the
approach of this calamity, and in preparation against it, that the
passages leading to the shrines of St Fabian and St Caecilia were
blocked against intruders, and that St Gregory expunged the mass sor
St Caecilia’s day from the Sacramentary he was editing, and set forth
one mass instead os two lor the common anniversary ol SS. Fabian and
Sebastian as a consequence oi that precautionary measure; il, 1 repeat,
the apprehended obsession os Rome by Agilulf was allowed by St
Gregory to make so deep a mark in his Sacramentary, are we to believe

that the Antiphonary would bear no trace ol it? What says the officium
sor the twentieth oi Januaryi The psalm is ‘Deus uenerunt gentes in
haereditatem tuam, polluerunt templum sanctum tuum, posuerunt
Ierusalem in pomorum custodiam? I do not say, ior 1 do not think,
that that psalm was chosen during the siege; sorl believe it to have
been chosen before the siege began. But there it was, and with it an

Introit which must have been suggested, not by the siege, but by the
invasion and the twenty-seven years’ occupation os central Italy. For
