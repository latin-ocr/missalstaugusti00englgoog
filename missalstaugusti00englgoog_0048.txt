Now, it is evident that the writer os this itinerary never misses an
opportunity ol notiiying the name and the site oi a church in which is
to be found the body os a saint whose anniversary is honoured with
mass and festum. And wherever we find such a saint mentioned as
patron oi a church we are told specifically that his or her body lies
in it, except in the two cases which 1 have italicized. How, then, is
this? Why, since the protomartyr Stephen was honoured year by year
with a festum, should not people have been directed to keep it in the
church dedicated to him? For the remarkable but satisfactory reason
that St Stephen's Church on the Coelian Hill-ior tirat clearly is the
church indicated-could not be the scene oi his festum, inasmuch as the
saint's body lay entombed in another building. But, is St Caecilia lay
in her own patronal church, why in this one and only instance should
such a fact not have been recorded sor the benefit oi those who might
wish to keep her festum? 1t had been kept iu the middle os the
fistlr century; why not keep it now in the middle os the seventhi
l see no escape irorn the difficulty but by supposing that, as a fact, her
festum was not kept, and that, as a lact, her body was not in the church
that bore her name; the two things being a double effect irorn a single
cause, namely, that her tomb had been rendered inaccessible.

And, indeed, the writer ol the Malmesbury itinerary would seem
to have been all unaware that an unseen and inaccessible tomb con·
taining Caecilia’s body existed somewhere underneath the church; sor
not only does he add no such memorandum as ‘ubi requiescit illa,'
or the like; he positively appends, as though to emphasize the absence
oi such memorandum, the names os no less than seventeen saints to the
exclusion oi Caecilia's.

Nay, more3 it would seem to be an open question whether the
compiler os the itinerary had any cognizance even oi a church os
St Caecilia; sor the Frankiort edition of 1601l is noticeable by the
absence os the words which, quoting irom Sir Thomas Hardy’s edition, 1
