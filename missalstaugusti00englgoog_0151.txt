INTRODUCTION. cxxxv

until he should finally and conclusively have assigned a proper officium
to every several saint's day. And when the same writer says (cap. LV),
‘antiqui de sanctis communiter in Paschalibus cantare solebant, unde et
adhuc ‘de uno quae ad plures pertinent cantantur,' whatever be our
speculation as to the earlier history of antiphonarial officiii, whatever our
opinion as to the felicity of the writer¹s explanation of the pheno
menon, we surely may be on our guard against taking it for granted
that a proper efficium was in St Gregory’s opinion a conditio sine qua
non to the celebration of an extra-paschal saint's day, any more than
that it was a conditio sine qua non within the paschal season. lt may
be, therefore, that the very few antiphonaria} indications exhibited by
our missal in the Gregorian masses of the latter portion of its Proprium
Sanctorum represent all the ‹ffcia contained in the corresponding part
of St Augustine's copies of the Antiphonary. And even should we sup-
pose St Gregory to have aimed at a Sanctorale as fully officed as was
his Temporale, there certainly is no reason to believe that he can by the
summer of the year 596 have done all that it was his wish and inten-
tion to do in a work so susceptible of minute and varied labour as the
psalmodic adornment and elucidation of each several sertum then kept
by the Roman Church. If, therefore, it be true that at the time of the
departure of his missionaries he had gone so far as to provide a twenty·
fourth, but not as yet a twenty-fifth officim for the post-pentecostal
dominical series of masses, it may also be true that he had not as yet
made definite assignment of officia to all the masses in his Proprium
Sanctorum, but only to the earliest of them, the most important of
them, those of them for which he had a special devotion, or those which
he may himself have happened to celebrate in propnb loco in one or
other year of his pontificate. Small, therefore, as is the number of
saints’ officm transcribed into the Corpus MS, it may not be far, if at
all, short of the full complement.

l now tum from speculation as to the precise stage attained by
St Gregory in the summer of the year 596 in his elaboration of the liber
antiphonarius to the antiphonarial officia which-whatever their pedi·
’ gree-have been transferred to our volume.

lf we assume that such of the offic-m preserved in the Corpus MS. as
belong to masses of Gregorian cognizance are themselves Gregorian,
and compare them with the corresponding officia in the Liturgicon of
Pamelius and the authorized Roman Missal, a working hypothesis may
be constructed, which l will endeavour in the present chapter to subject
to the test of facts. lt is, briefly, this :-That St Gregory made at least
