‘peruersum opus’ by classing the latter among the ‘peccata quae a iustis
uitari possunt,' and the former among the ‘nonnulla quae etiam a iustis
uitari non possunt?

But this is not all. ln a passage just now quoted (⁴ Transitorio
autem' dcc) the reader will have perceived an antithesis between prauitas
and haereditas. There is another (lv. xi), in which St Gregory seems
by prauitas to understand original sin itself, or the state of nature :-
‘Aurora quippe ecclesia dicitur, quae a peccatorum suorum tenebris ad
lucem iustitiae permutatur—quae prauitatis pristinae tenebras deserit, et
sese in noui luminis fulgorem conuertit'

On the whole, then, we are justified in saying that the ‘prauitate’ in
the prayer before us was, from its liability to misinterprctation, the very
sort of word which we might expect an authoritative reviset like St
Gregory to replace by an explicit and unmistakeable substitute such as
‘actione’ A better could not have been chosen; witness the following
from the sixth of the second book of the ‘Homiliae in Ezechielem:—
‘Finem non habent flagella caelestis iustitiae, quia nec inter flagella
correctae sunt actionis culpae.’

On perusing the introductory prayers os this mass in the Pio
Clementine, or any other edition of the Missal prior to our own, the
reader will observe that, with the sole exception of the ‘Deus qui tribus
pueris,’ they make explicit reference to the expected coming of the
Saviour at the feast of the Nativity; and itis hard to believe that, if
that particular prayer had in this particular place ever been made to
include such reference, the addition would have been allowed to
disappear. But, on the other hand, such addition might fairly be
looked for, if anywhere, in a book claiming to exhibit the text of a late
recension. Such a book is ours: and in our book is found the sort of
amplification that was needed to bring the ‘Deus qui tribus pueris’ into
harmony with the other prayers of the group to which it belongs. Our
book alone, at fol 9v, lin. 13, introduces the clause ‘adueniente lilio
tuo domino nostro' into the apodosis of the sentence.

Ῑ think, nevertheless, that this ablative clause and also the reading,
at line 18, of ‘deus' instead of ‘domine deus,' are instances of technical,
as distinguished from literary or theological, change3 and therefore, beg
leave to postpone their further consideration to another chapter. They
are notes of a fresh transcription; not merely proofs of a later re·
daction.

But, on the seventeenth line of the verso of fol. 9, we have a preferable
reading, independent of and, as 1 should suppose, antecedent to the
