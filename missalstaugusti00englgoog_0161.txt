‘quamdiu fuero,' ‘ne unquam’ and ‘ne quando,’ ‘tribuit mihi intellec·
tum’ and ‘mibi tribuit intellectum,' ‘qui inhabitare' and ‘qui habitare,¹
‘in capite eius’ and ‘super caput eius'3 where in the first member of
each pair there isan awkward juxtaposition of final and initial vowels
which is not to be found in the second. ln these instances the first
member of each pair is common to Pam. and Rom.; the second is
peculiar to ourselves.

On all this Ι have to remark: (1) That there are no converse in-
stances to qualify or cancel the force of this evidence, and (2) that
sibilation was the fault first rectilied, erasis being remedied on a later
revision. If, then, we infer that these twelve cases of rival reading are
not fortuitous, we may fairly assign them to St Gregory.

The instances just noticed embrace six out of the eleven—or, rather,
ten, for 6 and 8 are identical-comprised in Class A. Two of the re·
maining four are, ‘exaudi uocem meam' ‘exaudi orationem meam'
and ‘sanguinem seruorum tuorum,' ‘sanguinem sanctorum tuorum’

ln the twenty-third post-pentecostal ‹ffa'um Pamelius reads the
Offertory thus :-‘ De profundis...Domine exaudi uocem meam’; but
the Pian form is ‘De profundis...Domine exaudi orationem meam' dte,
as also is ours, which, however, ends at ‘meam' Here, as in previous
cases, the second and third redactions agree with each other as against
the first, and ‘orationem' would seem to represent the maturet judg·
ment of St Gregory.

But, curiously enough, the Alleluia Verse wams us against a hasty
inference. This constituent is in Pamelius supplied from another
psalm,-‘Dilexi quoniam exaudiet Dominus ⁴uocem orationis meae’;
but the Roman Gradual has ‘De profundis...orationem meam' When,
however, we turn to the Canterbury excerpts, we find ‘De profundis...
uocem meam’ ln other words, one and the same passage stands in
two different forms in one and the same officim3 and the Canterbury
monks-unless we take the unsatisfactory course of suspecting an un·
precedented clerieal error—sang ‘uocem meam' in the Alleluia Verse
and ‘orationem meam' in the Offertory. ’

How, then, shall we account for the differencei lt is, after all, but
the difference between the Pamelian ‘uocem' and the Pian ‘orationem'
between the τῆς φωνῆς μου of the Vatican Codex and the τῆς προσ-
ευχῆς μου of the Alexandrian. But why, after beginning with ‘uocem'
and then replacing it by ‘orationem’ should St Gregory in a third
edition have given his preference to neither and employed both? .

1 would venture to suggest: (1) that ‘orationem’ was the traditional
