This ‘qui uiuis' is in striking contrast with the ‘per’ and ‘per
dominum' ol the reprints; as also is that in the re-written Oratio on
fol. 8. Itis hard to believe that so necessary an ending as ours can
have been wilsully replaced by even the most retrograde scribe that ever
lived in critic’s lancy. Nor need we conjure up such people. The
eleventh of our typical instances, and the frequent occurrence ol the
inaccuracy ln the Verona book. justify the belief that ‘per' had been
imported direct from the prae-Gregorian repertory into Gregory's first
textos his Sacramentary, both here and in the previous instance just
cited from the Mass sor the Third Sunday in Advent.

But, more interesting by sarthan these is the difference between the
‘actione' of the Corpus MS. and the ‘prauitate' ol other copies And
here let me remark in passing that this case need not necessarily be an
exception to any general rule os equivalent textual substitution ; for the
vowels ol the second and fourth syllables ol the uncial PRAVITnTE may
very well have been enclavles in the preceding consonants, thus reducing
the word to the dimensions ol‘an average vocable os seven letters. But,
however this may be, the question that now concerns us is, lf either ol

the competing words be a Gregorian substitute sor the other, which ol
the two is it?
Now, nothing would seem to be more proper to St Gregory than the

use os ‘actio' in the sense ol ‘lise' or ‘conduct'; as when he says in the
second chapter (5 5) os the Presace to the ‘Moralia‘ ‘ex uita gentilium
redarguitur uita sub lege positorum, atque ex actione saecularium con-
funditur actio religiosorum'3 and again (xxxt. liv), ‘Qui tanta de tua
actione locutus es, cur, audita sanctorum uita, siluisti?'

The phrase, too, ‘actio nostra’ is proper to St Gregory; as where he
says, ‘Leue quippe uidebitur quod iniuria percutimur dum in actione
nostra conspicimus quia peius est quod mereremur,' and ‘totam se
[intentio nostra] in soliditate aeternitatis figat, ne si extra fundamentum
actionis nostrae fabrica ponatur terra dehiscente soluatur¹.' But, on the
other hand, 1 cannot in the whole course os the ‘Moralia’ find an
instance ol ‘prauitas nostra' ’

Ol course, it does not lollow hence that such a phrase as ‘prauitas
' nostra’ was impossible to St Gregory; indeed, he has allowed it to pass.
on one occasion into the missal (see iol. 31, lin. 11), and seems to have
made it his own (see fol. 50 v, lin. 14) on another. But it may well be
that he saw that in it which warned him to exercise some cantion in his
use, or in his adoption, of it.
