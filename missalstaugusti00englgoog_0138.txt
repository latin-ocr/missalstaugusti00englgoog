St Caecilia's Day-is, so to speek, made good by the introduction in its
close vicinity os a mass sor the Octsve ol St Andron, a weloome and
appropriate addition to the mass-book os the mother house in Rome os·
which St Andrew was the petron Redactions A and B had assigned
two messes to St laurence's Day (the tenth ot' August), and it the
Canterbury original had done the same we should, no doubt, find the
Corpus MS. in constituent agreement with B, giving to one mass the
prayers ‘Excita dne in aecclesia: dte, ‘Sacrificium nostrum‚’ &c and
‘Supplices te rogamus,' dre, and to the other‘Da nobis,' dre, ‘Accipe
q. d. munera: &c and ‘Sacro munere satiati‚' &c 1t has, however, only
one mass, and that a mass compiled, in part from one, and in part from
the other, os its presumable predecessore

Now, it has occurred to me, (i) that the cancelled constituents ol
the twentieth ol January and the suppressed post-pentecostal rnass in its
vicinity may have had the joint textual value ol a leaf ; (ii) that the can·
celled massot the sixth ol August and the suppressed constituents ol
the tenth may likewise have had the joint textual value ol a leas3 and
(iii) that the mass lor the Octave ot' St Andrew may be the textual
equivalent os the cancelled mass ol St Caecilia. 1 state the case in
general terms; but the reader will have no need to be told that, is all
this be true, the first and secundos the three operations must have
been complicated by inevitable modifications ol verbal text and by
many minute details ol readeptation.

As my theory cannot be tested without carelul counting, I count

as caresully as 1 can, and set down the result as briefly as may
be

Beginning with the first group,1 find that (i) the textual content os
the three several masses, as they may be presumed at one tirne¹ to
have stood in D, and (ii) the textual content ol the one composite mass
in D‘, as now presented to us in the Corpus MS„ are, respectively, as
follows. Here, as on previous occasions, I give the details in terms ol
letters :-

¹ lt ir morelly certain thet they were es in anelius end Μιιηῑοτί, with the sole exception
thet there hed been no Antiphonre in B, the redaction on which those editors worked.

Slmllerly, 1 heve no doubt thet the cancelled mess in honour ol St Caecilia was thet pn'nted
by Pemeliur end Mumtori. The ‘De sancte Cecilit’ which figures in the Corpus MS.. and
whlch we heve sufficient resson lor believing. on other munds, to be adventitioru, has the
constituent text, longer hy 35 letters, found in Mencrd. See below. p. cxxiv„ where 1 take my
