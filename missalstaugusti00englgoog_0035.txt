original record ol the month ol April, and might on that account claim
to be exempted lrorn appearing in evidence), nor any other ol the prae·
Gregorian records, knows anything ol St George. The Monza papyri,
the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, the Bucherian indiculus malceno
mention ol him 3 nor do the itineraries. The Liber Rontihcalis (ᾖ 224)
yields us our earliest information ¹. In its account ol Pope Zachary (RD.
742-752) we read, ‘Huius denique temporibus magnum thesaurum
Dominus Deus noster in hac Romana urbe per eundem almificum
pontificem propalare dignatus est ln uenerabili itaque patriarchio
[scil. lateranensi] sacratissimum beati Georgii martyris isdem sacratis-
simus papa in capsa reconditum ‘repperit caput, in quo et pictacium
inuenit pariter litteris exaratum Graecis ipsum esse significans Qui
sanctissimus papa omnino hilaris et satisfactus, illico aggregato Romanae
urbis populo, cum hymnis et canticis spiritualibus in uenerabili diaconia
eius nominis sita in hac Romana ciuitate, regione secunda, ad Velum
Aureum illud deduci lecit, ubi immensa miracula et beneficia omni·
potens Deus per eundem sacratissimum martyrem operari dignatur [seu
dignatus est].'

In all this there is no hint that the head was a lost treasure brought
to light again, or that the reason lor placing itin a church already dedi·
cated, as the Bollandists think', to St Sebastiam was that, though Rome
had once possessed a church in honour ol St George, it was no longer in
existence; nothing, however slight, to suggest that the cultus instituted
by Zachary was not a new thing but an old thing resumed. There is,
therefore, no ground lor believing that the missal which St Gregory’s
missionaries brought to England can have contained a massin honour
ol St George.

As to St Theodore, another oriental saint, a church is, indeed-said to
have been restored in his honour by Pope Adrian l. at the close ol the
eighth century. But the prae-Gregorian and sub-Gregorian records are
silent about him3 and, evidently, the monks ol St Augustine regarded
his cultus as a thing foreign to their house, lor they have by a marginal
obelus condemned his mass to deletion.

The earliest notice lound by the Bollandists ol St Eustace in con·

nexion with Rome is a passage in the Liber Pontificalis (ᾖ 404), in which,

In Velo Aureo was erected by Pope Iaeo 11. in the year 684, and dedicated to St Sebastiam
