now place within brackets :-‘ Et in altera ecclesia Tiburtius, Valerianus,
Maximus[. Non longe ecclesia Caeciliae martyris], et ibi reconditi sunt
Stephanus, Sixtus‚' llic.l Possibly enough, the cause ol the difference
between the two texts is beyond discovery; but, pending the acquisi-
tion os certain information on the subject, it is obvious to remark that,
unless the discrepancy be nothing more than the result os a clerical
error, the words, is anthemio, may have been suppressed by some early
reader who believed the saint's body to be still in the cemetery
ol SS. Tiburtius and Valerian; and that, il not authentic‚ they are in
all probability a gloss added aster the discovery made by Paschal
in 821².

Here, then, lor the present 1 leave the case os St Caecilia, hoping to
revert to it on another occasion and lor another purposc; lor it is time
to summarize and close this general survey os the rubrics os the
Proprium Sanctorum os the Corpus MS. What, then, is the lesson they
teach? The rubrics ol the Proprium de Tempore invited the inserence
that the Corpus MS. is a coadunation ol two, or more, documenta the
elder, or oldest, os which was rubricated in conformity with the custom
os the age os Gregory the Great Do the rubrics ol the Proprium
Sanctorum enhance or corroborate that inference? They both corroborate
and enhance it.

For we need only note the persistent monotony with which on every
possible occasion Menard’s ‘Missale sancti Eligii' repeats the seli-same
phrase-thus, ‘ldibus Augusti. Natalis sancti Hippolyti martyris‚'
‘x1x. kalendas Septembris. Natalis sancti Eusebii consessoris‚’ ‘xv.
kalendas Septembris. Natalis sancti Agapiti martyris '—to feel that
when dealing with that document we are dealing with a missal the
rubrics os which have been evacuated os any evidence they may once
have had to yield us. And the same is true ol Muratori's manuscript,
oi Da Rocca's, ol D'Azevedo's, and ol the Pio-Clementine Missal.
But, in dealing with the Corpus MS. we find that we have before us the
work ol one who simply copied what he had to copy, os one whose
business it had been to transcribe his materials, not to edit them; sor in
messes os Gallicam os Helvetian‚ os Spanish, os Italian saints, ablatives
and genitivos are employed, now the one form now the other, with
absolute indifference. Nevertheless, no sooner do we reach the charmed
