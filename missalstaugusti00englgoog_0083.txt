'ibe explanation, theu, which 1 propose is this :-That Gregory
found ‘uitam te nobis dedisse’ which he altered into ‘uitam nobis ue·
nisse’ by (1) erasing ‘TE’ and by (2) placing expunctory dots under the
two radical consonauts of ‘DEmssu’ suggesting that V and N should
take their place; but· that the pontiffs amanuensis blundered over the
second stage of the emendation. Or, we may exonerate the scribe, and
suppose the pontiff not to have been sufficiently clear in his instructions;
if indeed ‘instructions' be the proper word fora memorandum which
may have been meant for no eye but Gregory's. Had the contemplated
change involved the suppression of the whole of the word DEDISSE, the
accident, as we may well believe, would not have happened.

ln other words; Ι think the ‘uitam nobis dedisse’ of Pamelius and
Muratori to have been the reading of what 1 term Redaction 13¹, as
divulged by the scribe who worked on Gregory’s copy, and that it thus
holds a middle place between a pristine ‘uitam te nobis dedisse’ and the
‘uitam nobis uenisse’ of the Corpus M S.; but that it was no true reading
of the great editofs, its ‘dedisse’ being a substitution by clerical error
for the intended ‘uenisse’ Ι think, in short, that we owe it to the mere
oscitancy of a scribe that in this particular instance the vulgate text
differs from that of the Corpus MS.

Our intact Preface for Maundy·Thursday contains, at fol. 3511,
lin. 17, the following clause-‘quem [ludam] nec sacrati cibi collatio
nec superna pietas ab scelere reuocaret’; an admirable counterpart to
the contiguous ‘ut exemplum patientiae mundo relinqueret et passionem
suam pro seculi redemptione suppleret,' to ‘pascit igitur mitis deus
immitem iudam et sustinet pius crudelem conuiuam,' and to ‘o dominum
per omnia patientem inter suas epulas mitem? But the multiple
parallelism is broken if, with Muratori, Da Rocca, Pamelius and
Menard, we drop ‘nec superna· pietas' or if, with Tommasi in the
socalled Gelasian sacramentary, we omit ‘nec sacrati cibi collatio¹.’

Tommasi's ‘sub premio pietas' is probably a corruption of ‘superna
pietas'; and Ι would suggest (1) that ‘nec superna pietas' was the prae·
Gregorian reading, (2) that ‘nec sacrati cibi collatio’ was a marginal
addition made by Gregory himself in his own working copy, but (3) that
the copyist of what l call Redaction B mistook it fora substitute to
‘nec superna pietas’ which he therefore dropped, and (4) that the ‘nec
sacrati cibi collatio nec superna pietas' peculiar to our book is, like the

¹ Ι use this us a oonveuient term for the redectlmu to which is resemble the constituent text
of the oopiee edited by Pamelius and Muratori.
