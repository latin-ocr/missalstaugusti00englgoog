three redactions os his Antiphonary; that of these the first in order oi
time was one substantially but not verbally the same as that preserved
in the Pamelian collection, whilst the second was one substantially but
not verbally the same as the Pio-Clementine; but that the ‹ffa'a pre·
served in our volume are, except sor errors oi transcription, a faithful
representation oi the third.

For errors of transcription no one will be unprepared who has even
so much as set eyes on the slovenly batches os palimpsest writing which
disguise these precious items os salvage from a document which 1 be-
lieve to have been-whether actually or derivatively it would be hard
to say—one os the ipsa anuphonaria mentioned by Archbishop Egbert.

In the absence, however, oi conclusive proof that our extracts were
derived directly from such a document, 1 may be allowed to note a fact
which serves to prove that they may indeed have been so derived. On
the second Sunday in Lent only three words oi the Gradnal are given,
and these are followed by the rubric ‘chm're retro in seria quarta?
This is clear enough; but, very curiously, itis not all. Two very inter· ⁴
esting words are added to it; and the whole runs thus .·—‘ Require
retro in seria quarta ut supra? 1 take this to mean that the book
whence the parent copy oi this non-Gregorian rffia'um had been taken
was a book in which Gregorian and non-,Gregorian work stood in the
current text undistinguished the one from the other,-‘Requirc retro,’
&c.; but that the book into which it was transferred, and whence it
was copied into ours, was a book in which Gregorian work occupied
the body of the page, while non-Gregorian work was lodged in one or
other ol the three exterior margins, the lower margin being used in this
instance—‘ ut supra? These two instructions, ‘retro' and ‘ut supra,'
serve, 1 say, to prove that the volume whence our efficia were copied
was a volume ancient enough to carry only Gregorian officia in the body
ol its pages.

1 thlnk there cannot be a doubt that the Pio-Clementiae Gradual—
usually known as the Roman Gradual-represents an ultimate original
which held achronological place intermediate between the constituent
text represented by the Pamelian Antiphonary and the constituent text
oi our rescued offiw and that, os the three editions of which the three
collections are the witnesses, that indicated in our pages is the last.
