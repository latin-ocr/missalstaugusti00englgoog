3. Nor can that entitled ‘In octauis Epiphaniae’ claim a Gregorian
antiquity; for, as we are informed in a letter written ‘ad Albinum
abbatem' by Charlemagne on the subject ol octaves, ‘Natiuitas sanctae
Mariae non qualem diximus habet octauam, quia non est pro stola prima
cui adhibeatur in octaua secunda. Similiter nec Annunciatio Domini,
nec Ypopanti, nec Epiphania, nec Decollatio sancti loannis, neque
Natalis Domini; cum de matre nascendo non acceperit stolam primam,
sed moriendo primam et resurgendo secundam¹.’

4 St Gregory does not seem to have provided lor more than three
Sundays after Epiphany3 for Abbot Berno os Reichenau, who, although
a comparatively late authority, lor he lived early in the eleventh century,
nevertheless claims our respect as an acute and industrious liturgiologist,
says in bis treatise ‘De celebratione Aduentus Domini’ (cap. HL), ‘Ha-
bentur enim inter Natale Domini et Septuagesimam officia quatuor per
dies dominicos²'; a passage the contextos which evidently implies that
in his day the Gregorian crfficia lor the Sundays in question were believed
' to be equivalent in number with the Sunday masses ol that season put
forth by St Gregory. Hence the mass at fol 18 entitled ‘Dominica
tertia’ must be regarded as post-Gregorian, as also must that on sol.
171 v. ior yet another Sunday alter the Epiphany.

5. So, too, must that beginning at iol. 71, lin. ς, of which the same
auth0r⁸ tells usthat, although it figures in some sacramentaries, it is not
authentic3 whilst the author ol the Micrologus (cap. Lxu.) intimates
that he knows ol but one Sunday that can be termed ‘Praeparatio
Domini Aduentus⁴.'

6. In accordance‚ too, with an opinion which seems to be unanimous
amongst the old liturgiologists, we must regard as post-Gregorian the
masses lor all the Thursdays in Lent before Holy·week‚ and also that for
the Thursday in Whitsunweek.

Again, the missal which Augustine brought to Canterbury cannot
have assigned the mass ‘In letaniis' to the place it occupies in our
volume, the Monday before Ascensionday (iol. sou). Nor, if it be true
that the processior and mass ‘In litaniis majoribus’ were instituted as
late as the year 598, can it have stood where we now have ‘De sancto
Marco euangelista' (fol. 86 n). And, indeed, it has none ol the pre-
liminary prayers which are assigned in other books to the greater
litanies. It may, however, have stood in St Augustine's liber missalis
