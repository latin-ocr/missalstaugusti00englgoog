date, or, ii at all in his earlier years, yet only now and then. However
this may be, 1 think that not even the cancelled ‘apostolis ' in the Whit·
sunday ⁴ Communicantes’ isa more beautiful improvement on his earlier
editorial work than the conclusion oi the Oratio sor the following day.
The current ‘Per Dominum' is not heretical, and the Tridentine editors
may well have shrunk from superseding it; but it is no easy thing to
read the prayer in the light oi the Whitsunday Gospel-‘ pacem meam
do uobis,' ‘largiaris et pacem ’-without an admiring recognition ol the
appositeness and beauty of the reading proper to the Corpus MS, ‘qui
uiuis et regnas!

Is the anonymous editor¹ with whom Pamelius and Muratori have
made us familiar be right, Pope Gregory's constructive work was nearly
at an end when he reached the conclusion os Whitsun-week, a recent
predecessor having already done sor the greater part os the post-pente·
costal hall oi the year that which he himself had just accomplished lor
the greater part of the prae-pentecosta13 and the masses which the
pontifi had yet to revise or reconstruct were ten in number, those,
namely, sor the summer and autumn ember seasons and lor their
adjacent Sundays. They yield us several instances os textual diver·
gence.

The Hieronymian ‘quaerere’ ior ‘inquirere’ at fol. 5621, lin. 17, is
an infinitely more likely change than the converse would have been3
sor it is hard to think that Gregory the Great, finding St Jerome's
‘quaerere' in a phrase based on a well-known phrase in the Sermon
on the Mount¹, would have replaced it by the other word.

The Hieronymian ‘caritas Dei diffusa est'¹ may, possibly, have sug·
gested our ‘diffundas' at sol. 57, lin. 3, in the third oi the preliminary
prayers sor the Saturday ol the summer ember-week; and the more
so as the words form part oi the Antiphone for the day. The ‘defendas’
oi some oi the books must be a corruption of ‘dependas’ a word
already, it may be, grown obsolete in the days oi St Gregory, in the
sense, at least, required by the present context.

Our ‘afflictis misereris‘ at iol. 57, lin. 8, was not invited by any
grammatical necessity as a substitute sor ‘afflictos miseriis,’ nor may so
exquisite a reading be regarded as acorruption ol it l think it the
inspired amendment oi an authoritative editor.

We now come, sol. 66, lin. 7, to the second of the preliminary prayers
sor the Wednesday oi the autumn ember-week. The Verona book
