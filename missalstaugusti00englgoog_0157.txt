t0 be a reading proper to the Canterbury book. In so scanty a salvage
as our qfficia thirty-eight such variants are no inconsiderable gleaning.

The second is, that, with one exception-and we shall find that to
be a very remarkable one-the number of readings contested by the
three documents is in every instance, not three, but two. Thus, in
Ας the competing forms are ‘implebo' and ‘adimplebo' not, as they
might have been, ‘implebo' ‘adimplebo’ and ‘replebo'; in‘A7 they
are ‘nimis' and ‘ualde‚' not ‘nimis’ ‘ualde' and ‘uehementer'; in A 10
they are ‘uocem' and ‘orationem‘ not ‘uocem‘ ‘orationem’ and ‘cla-
morem’; at A 11 ‘seruorum' and ‘sanctorum' not ‘seruorum,'· ‘sanc-
torum’ and ‘castorum' And so on.

The third strikes the key·note of much that is about to follow :-

ln the very limited class which 1 call D¹, from the probability that,
but for the silence of the Pamelian book, its components would be
comprised in Class D, we find two palmary instances which serve in
some sort as types of many of the rest On the sixth Sunday after
Pentecost the Pio-Clementine Gradual reads Ps. 30, v. 2 thus-‘In te
Domine speraui, non confundar in aeternum, in iustitia tua libera me et
eripe me’; and with this the Vulgate agrees, but with the remarkable
difference that it has no ‘et eripe me’ This, however, is not the point
to which l would call attention; but rather that the Pio-Clementine
text is in all likelihood that of the Old Roman Psalter as St Jerome
found and as he left it; its words corresponding as nearly as they
could without κακοζηλᾶι to those of the Greek they were meant to
represent, ἐπί σοι κύριε ἤλπισα, μὴ καταισχυνθείην εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· ἐν’
τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ σου ῥῦσαί με καὶ ἐξελοῦ με. But the change found in
our book from ‘in iustitia tua’ to ‘in tua iustitia' is a departure from
the Greek order, and at the same time has the merit of obviating that
injury to the sense which might result from singing, or seeming to sing,
‘in iustitia’ as one word—‘ iniustitia tua' ’ It is obviously the later
reading, and it has so much to recommend it as to be the better
reading of the two. Let us provisionally set it down as a Gregorian
· change

Can the same be said of the third instance in D¹i By no means.
St Jerome may possibly have left, and, if so, St Gregory may have
found ‘non nocebit eum’3 and, having found it, may have corrected it
to ‘ non nocebit eil The converse order is inconceivable. '

These, 1 say, are in some sort typical instances Some of our·
readings are better than their rivals, some are worse. Can a theory
be framed which, without impugning the authenticity of the Pamelian,
