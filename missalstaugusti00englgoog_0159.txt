ln his ‘Explanatio Ps xliv.', addressed ‘Ad Principiam Virginem,‘ he
speaks, sometimes os the ‘editio uulgata,’ sometimes oi ‘quidam Lati·
norum’; but in that ‘Ad Sunniam et Fretellam,’ although he frequently
mentions the ⁴ Latini,' the ‘Latinus interpres' and the ‘antiqui codices
Latinorum,' he says nothing oi the ‘editio uulgata¹.' He seems, how·
ever, in his annotation on Ps 21, v. 24 contained in this letter, to imply
that the text revised by him in the old days at Rome was not that oi
the ‘Latinus interpres’; whereas both here and in other parts of the
epistle he seems to say that he had taken this latter as the basis oi his
Bethlehem translation. Suffice it to remember that, is his Bethlehem
translation was meant to be an editio classica of the Psalter‚ he might,
naturally enough, base it on as good a Latin text as he could find,
whereas his work when in Rome had been to amend and correct the
text which he found in use there.

Let us turn, then, to our excerpts.

Assuming, ior the sake oi argument, the authenticity oi the Canter-
bury Antiphonary, and being ready, but not too ready, to make some
allowance ior errors of transcription on the part os the motley crew oi
copyists to whom we are indebted sor so much oi it as sur'vives, it may
be worth our while to make a detailed examination oi some, at least,
os the instances in which it differs from one or both oi the other types
oi Gregorian Antiphonary, in the hope os learning, first, whether or not
the characteristico oi its verbal text be such as to justisy the assump-
tion, and secondly, whether or not those characteristics be 'such as
might be expected in a third, as distinguished from a first anda
second, edition.

ln many of the instances-though not by any means in allos
them—one os the two rival readings is also the Vulgate reading. But
that reading may be where it is-in the Pamelian, the Pio-Clementine
or the Canterbury text-not hya Vulgate provenance‚ but by another
route. Some oi them, most of them-though we cannot in prudence
say teos allos them-may he HieronymoRoman readings, readings
due to St Jerome's revision oi the Roman Psalter‚ and thus readings
older than the socalled Gallican Psalter‚ Is, then, only some of them
be such, the rest, or some ol the rest, being irreptions srom the Vulgate,
how may we hope to identisy them?

'We must, however, bear'in mind that a Hieronymian reading may
be an instance oi emendam or oi correctrh,· and that, although in
