about for some not unworthy elucidation of a state of things which there
are many and weighty reasons for regarding as other than the outcome
of blunder after blunder. We seem to have encountered, not an un-
meaning puzzle, but a soluble problem; and we must, if we can, find a
solution for it.

111. Knowing with, at least, moral certainty what⁴ were the
materials with which Gregory had to deal, let us see what he did and
how he did it

First, then, we are morally certain that the jejunial triad of masses
which he was about to ferialize were the triad known to us through
the edition of Pamelius.

And secondly, we are morally certain that the jejunial triad which
he intended to incorporate with his Sacramentary were not masses
composed, or even compiled, by himself They bear, indeed, no slight
resemblance to the second set of summer ember masses now to be found
in Menard and Da Rocca; but, asa matter of fact, they are only to be
identified with the ‘Orationes et Preces Mensis Quarti' of the socalled
Gelasian Sacramentary¹.

Thirdly, we may feel quite sure that, as the task he had set himself
was a technical task‚ he was too wise and too truly great to have any
scruple in contiding so much of its execution as was experimental to
the skill of a technical expett.

The leaves containing his own jejunial masses in Redaction D were
four in number. In D' six new leaves would take the place of them.

Handing his working copy of D to an amanuensis, he bade him test
the practicability of the scheme. What the amanuensis did with the
working copy seems to be clear enough. Allowing one Oratio, the
‘Praesta quaesumus‚’ to suffice for the Wednesday mass, and one, the
‘Mentibus nostris,' to suffice for the Saturday mass, and allowing the
Friday Oratio to remam, he cancelled the remaining five Orationes, and,
on finding that, with their rubrics, these filled m lines, he in the margins
of the four affected leaves proceeded to transcribe the ‘Gelasian' triad of
jejunial masses, in the hope of ascertaining whether, with general heading,
rubrics, minor rubrics and antiphonarial indications, they would be

found to till, precisely or approximately, ἧιῖἱῖο lines of the average
capacity of 18} letters. This, Ι say, he did, and in small writing‚ in the
margins of the four affected leaves of his masteffs working copy. When,
however, he had written all the prayers but three, he found that the
