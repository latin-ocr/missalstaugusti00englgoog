the Antiphona for Ascension-day that found in the Pameiien sud the
Pio-Clementine textS, and gives it in the same words :ffi‘viri Galilaei
quid admiramini aspicientes in caelum? alleluia, quemadmodum ui-
distis eum ascendentem in caelum ita ueniet‚' &c Its Offertory‚ how-
ever, is a newly selected one, the very same passage as the Antiphone.
But, although the same passage, it is the same passage under another
guise :—‘ Viri Galilaei, quid admiramini aspicientes in eaelum? Hie
Jesus qui assumptus est a uobis sic ueniet quemadmodum uidistis
eum ascendentem in caelum‚' a text which in its turn differs from that
οἵ the Lectionary by reading ‘ascendentem,’ where the latter has
‘eunteml ’

We must not, therefore, be surprised to find that, though the reading
of the Antiphona to the first of the ember masses of the summer quai-ter
had been—presumably, at least‚——‘ Deus cum egredereris¹ the first of the
new group of ember masses yields a different reading—³ Deus dum
egredereris! The contrast, so far from surprising ηε, should rather he
hailed as a confirmation of the fact that the new group is s. eompara-
tively late insertion of St Gregory’s—in other wordS, that our present
triad of ember masses as set down for use in the ‘ plena hebdomada post
Pentecosten,’ was compiled at a later date than our present tried of
ferial masses for the Wednesday, Friday‚ and Satan-day in Whitsun-
week¹.' It is to these that 1 now desire once more to call the attention
of my readers' 2-

A twofold task lay before the pontiff. He was to convert what had
erewhile been the ember masses of Whitsun·week into a feriol triadg,
and, compiling a new jejunial group, was so to compile them as that
their textual value should secure him an aggregate nett inerement
having the value of neither less nor more than four pages os the average
capacity.

When dealin'g with this subject in an earlier chapter Ῑ assumed
that no antiphonarial indications had been introduced into the pristine
group of ember masseS, and Ι did so because it would haue intersered
with the progress of the argument to discuss at that moment a question
of minute detail which had no relevancy to the subject then in hand—
the claim of two competing sets of antiphonarial indications to represent
the earlier state of things

¹ Τὴε Thursday mass is post-Gregorian and we have just now no concern with it* except to
remark that its changed Oratio is a consequence resulting from the supersession ol' the * Praesta
