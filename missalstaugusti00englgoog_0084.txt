‘uitam nobis uenisse' which we have just been considering, the correction
01 3 01011031 error. My readers must judgc 101 themselves 01 the
plausibility 01 11113 view; but, even 11 they hold some other theory as to
the cause 01 1110 divergence between this and previous editions, they will,
l think, agree with me that here, as in other instances, ours is the reading
which carries off the palm 01 excellence. Ι shall have on a later page to
revert 10 the 1301 that the number 01 1011013 10 ‘nec sacrati cibi collatio’
is twenty-two.

Nor can there bea question as to the superiority 01 001 ‘patientiae'
at iol. 36, lin. 2, to the vulgate ‘innocentiae’ Some such word is
necessary to the multiple parallelism to which 1 have just drawn
attention; and, independently 01 that consideration, the evident purport
oi the context is to exhibit our Divine Lord as the model 01 patience,
forbearance and sets-restraint. ⁴

Nothing is more remarkable in the Verona book than the persistency
with which a perfunctory ‘Per' is made 10 110 duty, sometimes insuf-
ficiently, sometimes unsuitably, as, l believe, the sole ending 01 113
several prayers. lt need not, therefore, surprise those 01 my readers
who are by this time disposed to regard the rival readings 113 the
outcome 0130 unpersected revision, to find that, in addition to the
instances 01 13130 ending already recorded,a sourth and 111111, 31101. 3711,
lin. 10 and 110. 20, await 001 001100. Α

Most 01 the previous editions give the Good·Friday prayer 101 the
Pope thum-⁴0. s. deuius iudicio uniuersa fundantur respice propitius
ad preces nostras et electum nobis antistitem tua pietate conserua, ut
christiana plebs quae tali gubernatur auctore sub tanto pontifice creduli-
tatis suae meritis augeatur. Per dominum! Written thus, the prayer
10103 the Pope into the ‘auctor gubernans’ 01 1110 Church; and, indeed,
Tommasi's so-called Gelasian sacramentary, which associates the bishop
01 the diocese with the proper subject 01 1110 prayer, turns ‘tali...'auct0re'
into ‘talibus...auctoribus,’ reading also ί0100103...3011311103” 3011 ‘tantis
pontificibus! But, as a matter 01 1301, 1110 Pope is not the ‘auctor
gubernans' 01 1110 Church; and there must, assuredly, be something
wrong somewhere in the prayer as thus read. Muratori is the only editor
who, 101113000111311330010103300103 to find ‘te...auctore'; and this is
1110 reading 01 1110 authorized Roman Missal But, though this reading
avoids heresy, it labours under the objection 01 assigning to the Etemal
Father the proper 10001100 01 the Second Person 01 1110 Holy Trinity.
