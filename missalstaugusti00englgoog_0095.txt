found, and was for a time content to leave, it in the present place as he
found it; that in masses, however, of his own compiling he observed
the converse order; and that it was only at a subsequent revision, that
proper to the redaction represented by the Corpus MS, that he corrected
the less good reading of his predecessors’ allowance so as to bring it
into conformity with his own.

ln the textus rescrrptus on fol. 17 v. we read ‘ad eorum [sacramento
rum] premia capienda' where ‘premia’ replaces the ‘promissa' of the
other texts. St Gregory would, I think, be inclined to condemn ‘capere
promissum' as unidiomatic; just as no one to whom our language is a
classic would deliberately seize, snatch, grasp or carry off a promise in
preference to a prize. And, indeed, if, disregarding fora moment the
immense presumption which really exists in favour of the chronological
priority of the vulgate reading, we turn to Gregory's latinity in quest of
evidence as to the pontiff’s preference of a word, all doubts will speedily
vanish The substantive ‘promissum’ seems to be absolutely excluded
from his vocabulary3 for the ‘promissa coelestia’ of the following
passage must surely mean ‘promised joys of heaven,' not ‘heavenly
promises,'-‘Sunt...nonnulli qui...promissa coelestia petitionibus se·
quuntur, operibus fugiunt' (xxlv. xxvii). And even of ‘promissio' 1
lind but four instances, as against sixty or seventy of ‘ praemium¹.'

With the certain exception of our ‘malis' for ‘delictis’ at fol. 68,
lin. 16, and the probable exception of our ⁸ pietatis’ for ‘potestatis' at
64v, lin. 14, and of our ‘consortes’ for ‘ participes' at fol. 6721, lin. 19,
1 do not think that any more of the present list of substitutions can be
regarded as corrections, whether of questionable theology or os doubtful
latinity. But, that they really are, what 1 call them, substitutions, there
cannot, 1 think, be a doubt ; because in every instance our reading
exhibits, however slight a superiority, yet still a superiority over the rival
forrn. As to St Gregory’s presumable preference for ‘participes' or

‘consortes' 1 cannot find more than two references ; but they are, 1
think, instructive. Mankind in general (xxi. xix.) are ‘naturae nostrae
consortes ’; the Incarnate Word (xxll xxi.) ‘particeps nostrae sactus est
naturae!

Such, then, is the resultes our researches in the verbal text of the
primitive portion of our Proprium de Tempore. Let us tabulate all
the instances, and then tum to the adscititious messes

¹ Amongst these are ‘recipere praemium’ or ‘percipere praemium’ at cxxv. 51411, 808 n,
108511and Lxxvu 4451). The references for ‘promissio’ are LxxV. 11350 and Lxxw. 1700.
