Roman :-‘ De ordinatione et dispositione missalis libelli nescio cur
demandasti Numquid non habes Romano more ordinatos libellos
sacratorios abundanter? Habes quoque et ueteris consuetudinis sus-
ficienter sacramentaria maiora Quid opus est noua condere dum uetera
sufficiunt¹?' The obvious meaning of this seems to be that the ‘sacra-
mentarium maius' and the ‘libellus sacratorios '-0r, as a Cassinese
monk in the eleventh century would have said, the ‘sacramentaria
unum et alterum’-when used the one as complement to the other,
supplied between them the prayers contained in the ‘libellus missalis'

When, then, we find Egbert, Archbishop Eanbald's immediate
predecessor, writing about a ‘liber missalis' and writing about it with
a necessarily implied regard to the ‘mos Romanus‚' we may assume
that he fully appreciated the signification os the term, and that he, ii
any one, would know what in Roman usage the term was intended to
signify². But there are three interesting leatures about Archb'ishop
Egbert’s employment ol the phrase. One is, that it is the earliest as·
certained instance os its employment3 another is, that the specific
‘liber missalis' os which Archbishop Egbert wrote was the very book
which Gregory the Great sent to England by Augustine3 and, carried
thus bya single flight oi thought from York in the eighth century to
Rome in the sixth,1 should be dull indeed did 1 not perceive, in the
third place, that Egbert speaks os this mass-book os Gregory's as ‘suus
missalis liber,' as also oi ‘ missalia sua?

1 think, then, that, true though it be that Gregory gave the title ol
‘Liber sacramentorum' to the first edition oi his liturgical compilation,
the edition which he sent to England was entitled, and entitled by
himself, ‘Liber Missalis'; that he called it ‘Liber Missalis' because he
had introduced into it, certainly the canon, probably an ‘ordo missae';
and that a reason for thus associating.in a single volume the canon
and his compilation oi ‘sacramenta' or liturgical prayers‚ was that
the compilation was now sufficiently revised to justiiy him in doing so.

But, it may be asked, 1f this be so; what accident, caprice, necessity,
can have urged the scribe ol the Cor'pus MS. to write an alien textos
the canon? Is the monks oi St Augustine's had St Gregory's text in
their libri missales, why did he not use iti Ι shall attempt an answer
to these questions in a later chapter.
