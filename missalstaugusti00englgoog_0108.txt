ueniente’ for ‘intercedente' Both alterations may, as in instances
which occurred in the preceding chapter, be attributable to the cir-
cumstance of a new transcription direct from original sources

A place in the liturgica! prayers of the Roman Church had been
assigned to SS. Felix and Adauctus long before the time of St Gregory's
editorial toil, for they figure in the Verona book (xxm. ih Our three
variants on fol. 116 are not unworthy to rank as later touches from the
pen of the compiler. The first of them has its counterpart in the 'in...
commemorationem' at fol. 5 5 at, lin. 7.

That our mass, at foi. 130, in honour of the Quatuor Coronati is of the
primitive portion of the Missal of St Augustine's, Canterbury, need not
be doubted, for the four have proper masses in the Verona MS. (xxxv).
indeed, all the saints thus honoured in the prae-Gregorian collectiones
now known to us, would seem to have had the like distinction in the
recension represented by the Corpus MS, with the exception of the
Chalcedonian St Euphemia, and of SS. Sixtus, Pontian and Caecilia,
who were precluded-such, at least, is my view-from a separate and
proper festal celebration till such time as the concealed crypta in the
cemetery of St Calixtus should be restored to sight That our text
of the Mass of the Quatuor Coronati isos later redaction than the
text represented by other editions, is proved (i) by the fact that their
'gloriamur' is the Verona reading (xvl. xiii), and (ii) by the further fact
that the contrast between their ‘gloriamur' and our ‘gaudemus’ is in
noteworthy analogy with the ‘prauitate’ and ‘actione' the ‘tribue' and
'‘ praesta‚’ the ‘seruiamus’ and ‘famulemur,' the ‘incessanter’ and ‘indesi-
nenter,’ of the Proprium de Tempore.

The latinity of the prae-Gregorian popes would seem to 'have
affected ‘gloriari'3 witness the following from Verona :-‘ Da...ut...sic
gloriemur de nouis utnon abutamur antiquis’ (xm. iv), ‘Da nobis...
sanctorum martyrum passionibus gloriari ’ (xvn. iv.)‚ ‘Largire...ut qui de
natiuitate...tui Filii gloriantur' &o (XL. i.), and (at xvh xiii) the present
Postcommunion as given in other MSS. On the other hand, Ι find

hutone instance of ‘ gaudere' (xxlx. vii), and even iu that the word is
employed in conJunction with ‘gloriari' as though to prove that nothing
short of the peril of tautology had counselled its toleration in the
phrase,—‘Deus...da nobis sicut de initiis tuae gratiae gloriamur ita de
perfectione gaudere¹.’
