of St Sixtus, otherwise known as the emeterium S. callati, and there
placed in a loculus already prepared for it in a small chamber adjoining
that now known as the papal crypt; that towards the end of the sixth
century the approaches to the two chambers were carefully obstructed
so as to arrest and baille the attempts of depredators; and that thence-
fonvard, although a small basilican church built on the south side of the
Appian Way on land overlying the cemetery of St Sixtus may for some
time have borne the name of St Caecilia, yet the body of the virgin
martyr was not sought for, or if sought for was not found, no mortal
neye beholding her later sepulchre‘for a long stretch of time until in the
year 821 it confronted the wondering gaze of Paschal Ι.

The history of the discovery of her body is, briefly, as follows :-

After the siege of Rome by the Lombards in the year 756 some of
the catacombs, which had already suffered much, now from foreign
depredation‚ now from domestic neglect, were found by Pope Paul
1. to be ina condition of disrepair such as to justily him in removing
the relics of the holy dead from their tombs and bringing them within
the walls of the city. The Liber Pontificalis (§ 259) says of him, ‘Hic

desideria [sic] antiquitatis maxima demolitione, atque iam uicina ruinae
posita, protinus eadem sanctorum corpora de ipsis dirutis abstulit
coemeteriis. Quae cum hymnis et canticis spiritualibus infra hanc
ciuitatem Romanam introducens, alia eorum per titulos ac diaconias, seu
monasteria et reliquas ecclesias, cum condecenti studuit recondi nonore!
This precedent, which seems to have been confined to a limited area of
the catacombs, was some sixty years later followed ona much larger
scale by Paschal l.‚ who, as we are informed by an inscription still
extant in the Church of Sta Prassede, on the twentieth day of July in
the year 817 enclosed withinthe precincts of that building and of the
Church of St Agnes the bodies, or what remained of them, of two
thousand three hundred sancti&

Conspicuous among the names recorded in this inscription are those
of several Popes whose remains Paschal had found in a chamber
appertaining to the subterranean cemetery of St sixtus, and now known

as the papal crypt
Meanwhile he was secking for the body of St Caecilia, but secking
