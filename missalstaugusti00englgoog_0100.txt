compositions. But, irom whatever elements elaborated, it must have

Ι may add that another Thursday massin Lent gives us, at iol. 30,
lin. 12, the uncorrected prae-Gregorian ‘preces quae tibi gratae sunt'
of the Verona book (xxiii. iil), in striking and instructive contrast to
the exquisite ‘preces quae tibi gratae sint’ peculiar to ourselves at
fol. 342¹, lin. 16 in a mass oi Gregorian compilation.

Again, in the Secreta oi yet another Thursday mass in Lent, at
iol. 322¹, lin. 5, the ‘munera iussisti dicanda’ of the Verona book
(xxvll. viii.) is in the Corpus MS. altered for the worse to ‘iussisti
munera dicanda'3 while in the ‘Pro Populo’ os the same mass our
first reading was ‘repleamur’ sor ‘repleantur’ True though it be that
the reading may have been no more than a mere clerieal error, 1 may
venture to remark that such an error would not have been likely to
happen had this particular mass been copied from an exemplar in
uncial writing. The significance oi this consideration will appear in
the sequel.

Although, at iol. 71, lin. 11, an adventitious mass is found to retain
a prae-Gregorian reading, ‘nostrae conditionis' <see xvlll. xix. os the
Verona book), that reading varies irom the ‘conditionis nostrae' yielded
hythe textus rescn'ptur, on sol. 8, oi a compilation which had undergone
the editorial supervision os St Gregory. And in the same mass we
have, as in the ‘repleamur' just noticed, a reading which, one would
suppose, would not have crept into the text except by derivation irotn
a non-uncial exemplar. ‘l refer to the manifestly corrupt ‘et’ ior ‘ut’
in the passage ‘Animae nostrae q. o. d. hoc potiantur desiderio et a
spiritu tuo inflammentur: &c

of these nine pairs oi rival readings there are three (the first, second
and eighth) with which we need not‘ concern ourselves; but in the re·
mainiug six, where one member oi the pair is a bad reading, that bad
reading is invariably our own. In other words, wherever in the post·
Gregorian masses oi our Proprium de Tempore an opportunity is ai·

reading peculial· to the Corpus MS. is found to be as singularly and
conspicuously bad as in masses oi Gregorian cognizance it is singularly
and conspicuously good.

This, il anything. would seem to prove that the provenance oi the
