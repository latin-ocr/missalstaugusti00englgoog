As to the verbal textos the printed editions, amongst which must be
included the Leofric Missal¹, the caseis very curious. Assuming that
Pamelius's book is an accurate copy of the document it professes to
represent; that the texts of Muratori and Da Rocca were executed‚ as
their editors thought, in the ninth century, and that Menard's manu-
scripts were of the same date ; we get back to about two centuries and a
half from the death of Gregory the Great, and we have liturgical com·
pilations as used in some, at least, of the Churches of Gaul and Germany.
Assuming that D'Azevedo’s text is what that editor believed it to be,
atranscript of a book brought from Spoleto to Rome in the year 817,
we get to a slightly earlier date, and we have a liturgical compilation as
used in Italy. But, much as these books differ from each other in
structural order and arrangement, much as they differ from each other
as to the prayers that constitute their several masses, whenever a prayer
claiming to be Gregorian and assigned to some specified occasion is
found in two or more of them, it is found, with a few rare and insignificant
exceptione, under one and the same verbal form.

Is, then, this verbal text of the editions hitherto published an

authentic text? And, if it be authentic, is there any other that asserts
the same claim? And if such there be, what is its history, and on what
is its pretension grounded?

Tun Holus nuo Dare or MS. C. C. C. C. 270.

That the manuscript Missal numbered 270 in the Catalogue of the
Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, was written for the use
of the Abbey of SS. Peter and Paul-commonly known by its later
name of St Augustine’s-without the walls of Canterbury, is evident
from the following facts :-

The mass in honour of St Augustine, at fol. 92 v, is adorned with
a highly elaborated initial letter—a detail of very rare occurrence in the
document.

At fol 78 v. there is a mass, two of whose capital letters are highly
adorned, in honour of Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury.
He died in 619, and was buried at St Augustine's

¹ 1 have constantly referred to Mr Warren’s edition, which is substantially the same as
Mennd’s reprint. lt is, however, so easy of necess, and it contains so little that is peculiar
to itself, thet I have not included it in the collatiou.
