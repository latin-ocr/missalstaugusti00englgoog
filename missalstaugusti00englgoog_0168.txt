sistency in the first redaction, consistency in the second and third; 'in
A9we find the second and third redactions repudiating the κακοζηλία
which the first had tolerated.

· And what l have already said in regard of other instances is true of
these. The evidence is unchallenged. No converse changes are to be
found. On the contrary, A9 is but repeated by AD 2. ’

So much for Class A.

Class B differs from the rest in shewing us the first and third redac-
tions in agreement with each other, but in conflict with the second. Its
seven instances are really six in number, for two of them are identical;
and the number is further reduced, if we regard the fifth and seventh as
the mere product of a rubricator's blunder. And even of the four thus
lest one, as we shall see presently, has no serious claim to rank as
authentic3 and the number of cases in which St Gregory can even be
thought to have allowed his second redaction to differ from the others
is reduced to three: vir„ ‘Iubilate Deo' as against ‘lubilate Domino,'
‘custodit ea’ as against ‘custodiet ea,’ and ‘usque ln saeculum' as
against ‘in saeculum?

Berno of Reichenau in his ‘De uaria Psalmorum atque Cantuum
Modulatione¹’ says,—‘ In illa offerenda Iustitiae Domini dre, quia de·
sunt illa uerba quae in psalterio posita sunt usque in illum locum et
dulciora super mel et fanum, rectius caneremus Iustitiae Domini...et
dulaores’ &a Bemo's copies thus agreed with Pam. and MS. and l
suspect that we are indebted to the Tridentine editors for the preferable
et iudicia eius dulciora &a of the Roman Gradual ·

It is, of course, possible that St Gregory exscinded the intervening
words and then forgot to change ‘dulciora’ into ‘dulciores' But is·
there not a less rough and ready explanation?

The whole passage is as follows :-

Lex Domini immaculata, conuertens animas:

testimonium Domini fidele, sapientiam praestans paruulis:
iustitiae Domini rectae, laetificantes corda:

praeceptum Domini lucidum, illuminans oculos:

iudicia Domini uera, iustificata in semetipsa,-
desiderabilia super aurum et lapidem pretiosum multum
et dulciora super mel et fauum.

The parallelism of the first six of these seven lines is 'evident Sup-
posing, then, that St Gregory’s Offertory comprised the last four of the
