place than that. That one instance occurs, at 101. 54 u, lin. 9, in the
Oratio 01 the Tuesday mass in Whitsun-week; and I find, to my
surprise, that is my computation be correct, the Oratio 01 that mass
must have begun on the last line 01 0 verso page, and that its rubric—
is written at all—must have been written at the end 01 such last line.
This is as pretty a confirmation 01 the figures 011 page clxxiv as
could be desired. The masses 101 Sunday and Monday represent an
aggregate 01 (53 440÷ 336÷2y4=l 703 letters, or 38 lines, since
703 = 38 >c 1835 and 1 make no doubt that, early in the Tuesday mass,
our artist, passing from the ‘unt-¹ at the loot 01 0110 page to the ‘TUS'
at the head 01 the next, overlooked the vermilioned ‘0R' which
adjoined the first moiety 01 the word. Shall l go a step further, and

between ourselves and Pamelius on the Saturday alter Ash·Wednesday,
on the eighteenth post-pentecostal Sunday and on the Feast 01

as modified in our book, the mass 101 the Vigil 01 SS. Peter and Paul
has a complement 01 370 letters. Any future student who may under-

take the herculean task 01 reconstructing the Proprium Sanctorum 01
the exemplar may, I think, take it 101 granted that this mass occupied,
precisely‚ one side 01 0 1001.

IV. l need scarcely remind the reader, though it has seemed
needless to insist upon it in my concluding chapters‚ that the theory
01 0 working copy is strongly recommended by the rubrical peculiarities
near the close 01 the Proprium de Tempore.

V. But it may be well to add that Archbishup Egbert’s account
01 the ‘plena hebdomada post pentecosten’ yields an implicit 01001
01 the authenticity 01 the post-pentecostal series, a proof impregnable
in its conclusiveness.
