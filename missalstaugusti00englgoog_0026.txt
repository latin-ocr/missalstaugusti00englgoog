Surely he was one whom it was not for the reviset to command; else
why the memorandum at all?

On referring to the chronological table prefixed to Thomas of Elm· ·
ham's ‘Historia' Ι find that on the thirteenth of March, 1099, a stranger
to the monastery was consecrated Abbot of St Augustine's in the person
of Hugh, a Fleury monk¹; and it seems to me that such an one, the
alumnus of a house which had within living memory supplied half
England with books on the resuscitation of religious houses destroyed
by Danish invaders, which boasted a scriptorial school of unsurpassed
renown, and which at this moment had colonies of its scribes in our
island, may have been, of all men, the most likely to chale against the
conservatism of a very conservative house, and to aim at amplifying and
expanding its venerable liturgy into conformity with the missals by this
time in general use throughout western Christendom.

On the whole, then, I do not think that a more plausible conjecture
than this can be found as to the date and the occasion of our manu·
script; namely, that it was executed in or about the summer of 1099
for the personal use of Hugh of Fleury, the newly consecrated Abbot
of St Augustine's.

If 1 may take for granted, what Ι hope to prove in the sequel‚ that
the monks of St Augustine’s were still in possession of one or more of
the missals which their founder brought to Canterbury in the year 597,
I should say that the Corpus MS. was executed on the understanding
that, whatever new masses might be proposed for use in their monastery,
so much of its constituent and so much of its verbal text as was refer·
able to the august document of which Gregory the Great was the com·
piler should undergo no change. On this subject Ι will make one or two
very brief observations, and will then address myself to the task that lies
before me.

ι. The scribe, who certainly had before him a collection of Prefaces
such as we find in Pamelius and Muratori, and who seems to have been
unwilling to assign one and the same Preface to the Feast of the
Epiphany and the succeeding Sunday, followed the use by this time
almost universal and apportioned the composition ‘Quia notam fecisti‚’
dte, to the first of these days [fol. 16, lin.19], and the ‘Quia per
unigeniti,’ dre, to the second; but a correcting hand has broken boldly
in upon this change, and, erasing so much of the ‘Quia notam' as
