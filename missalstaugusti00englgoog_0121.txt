perceiving a difference, not in the handwriting, which is the same, but
in the writer’s manner ol wielding the pen. He never in the latter hali
oi the volume seems-to be cramped lor wantos space, and rarely so
writes a prayer as to make it fill as lew lines as possible, leaving a
residuum os words or syllables or, it may be, of one short syllable to be
accommodated in the same line with the opening words oi the succeed-
ing prayer. But, in the earlier pages this remarkable economy ol space,
and this remarkable way oi effecting it, are oi perpetual recurrence; the
result being, that in the first few leaves any five lines contain, at the
least, as many letters as any six lines in the second hali ol the volume.
l think that is the ruled space in our pages had been hall an inch wider
than it is, and that is the trammels which bovum our transcribet had
never been relaxed for the admission os adventitious and intrusive work,
this difference would not have come to pass3 and the conjecture seems
to be a reasonable one, that the penman entered on his task with the
intention oi crowding a certain amount oi text into a given number
oi lines. ξ

ll, then, we suppose him to have been working on narrow columns
os uncial character, can it be possible that the task he set himself was
that of making a single line ol his transcript the equivalent of two lines
in his exemplar? The theory is plausible enough; ior-

1. 1. There is no reason in theology or in grammar why he should
at fol. 9, lin. 8, have written ‘Prope esto domine‚' not ‘Prope est0’; but
the aggregate number oi letters in ‘hwROPEffiTOD‘tlE’ and the adjacent
‘ORATIO' is nineteen, or about hali the number os letters contained in
a lull line of the Corpus writing. .

2. lt is hard to see why, but sor some such reason as this, he should
at iol. ran, lin. ¹7, have stopped where he did, leaving his preposition to
govern nothing-‘A- Etenim sederunt principes et aduersum? ι These
words, with a necessary but omitted on· are oi the value of two such
lines as l have indicated.

3. At iol. 24, lin. 5, we have the same textual value in ‘DOM1N10n·
11 · xL·ri·Ran1u1scsRs ursa · onnam! 1 cannot otherwise account lor
this curious truncation oi the word ‘miserationum'

4 ,The theory I have advanced affords the only plausible ex-
planation l can find lor the strange ‘Uocem jocunditatis annun—tf at sol.
50, lin. 12. These letters with the adjacent rubrics ‘DOM1N1cn· U·’ and
‘ORATIO' are of the value os two lines oi nineteen letters.

ΙΙ. Pursuing my investigation,l find that our transcribet has two
ways oi dealing with the syllable or syllables remaining to him over and
