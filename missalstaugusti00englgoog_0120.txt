puts usin touch with a parent document the date ol which cannot have
been later than the closing months ol the year 624, and may have been
earlier than 606; lor it is uncertain which it was ol the three popes
bearing the name of Bonisace, and living between those two dates, who

incredulity to doubt the substantial identity os the parent os the
primitive portioris os the Corpus MS. with the missale brought to our
land in the year 597, and handled by Archbishop Egbert in the course
