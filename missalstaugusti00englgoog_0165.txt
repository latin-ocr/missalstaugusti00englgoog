gentes Ubi est Deus eorum?,’ ‘si consistunt aduersus me castra non
timebit cor meum,’ ‘illumina oculos meos...nequando dicat inl·
micus Praevalui aduersus eum,’ ‘protector noster aspice Deus'3 and
so on, sor innumerable instances The Divine protection is, indeed,
acknowledged in many places, and not invoked merely; but it is a
protection the need os which is‘urgent, a protection which may not be
relaxedz-‘Ecce Deus adiuuat me...auerte mala inimicis meis,' ‘in
ueritate tua disperge illos, protector meus Domine' One officim that
for the seventh Sunday (sol. 61), does, indeed, open with a strain os joy,
but the strain soon drops to tonos os sadness and ends with the very
remarkable ‘ut eruas nos,’ a reading peculiar to ourselves, which Ι must
notice without further delay.

l notice it at once, because it seems to justisy the account 1 have
hazarded os the reading ‘ uindica sanguinem sanctorum tuorum?

ln the ninth os our post-pentecostal offida we have (Ps 30, v. a) ‘In
te Domine speraui, non confundar in aeternum, in tua iustitia libera me
et eripe me, inclina ad me aurern tuam, accelera ‘ut eripias me’¹; and
substantially the same reading is found in the PioClementine on the
sixth Sunday¹. But on the seventh Sunday our Communion reads
thus :—‘ Inclina aurem tuam accelera ut eruas nos,' where it will be
observed that the words ‘ad me' are omitted, ‘eruas nos’ taking the
place of ‘eripias me⁸.’ The Pamelian and Pian books have thesaure
constituent, but with the remarkable differente that, while both omit ‘ad
me,' the former ends with ‘eruas me} the latter with ‘eripias me.’ It
may be that it was by no economy of treatment, but sor some other
reason, is sor any, that St Gregory dropped ‘adme' in the first and
second editions; but the sact remains that the one edition which con·
verts the passage into a common prayer sor deliverance from a common
danger is that which exhibits the very remarkable substitution which
we have been examining in the officium sor SS. Fabian and Sebastian.

The thirtieth Psalm is unipersonal lt is incredible that any
Septuaglnt text should have cancelled and superseded so marked and
prevalent a characteristic; and that it was used by Gregory as uni·
personal, is evident from the ninth officium of the series Nor can we
think that κοινή, whatever its extravagances of corruptio ‘pro locis et
temporibus et pro uoluntate scriptorum,' could have committed an
