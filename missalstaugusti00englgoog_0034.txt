masses oi our volume, though two will ere long be seen to occur in the
English category; 1 mean the ‘De sancta Anastasia,' at fol. 11 v,
a title marking the first oi three prayers which „are severally coupled
with the corresponding Oratio, Secreta and Postcommunion oi the
second mass sor Christmas-day. But, although this ‘De sancta
Anastasia' illustrates and justifies my explanation of the title ‘De
sancta Felicitate,’ it falls in the Proprium de Tempore. lt follows,
therefore, is my view be correct, that the Proprium Sanctorum os
St Gregory's liber missalis had only one instance oi ablativecase title
reserable to the circumstance of concurrence.

When, however, l examine such other ol the presumably Roman
masses as have ablativecase titles 1 find a lew conceming which
ordinarily well-informed students could not, in my opinion, with pro·
priety be expected to say, without previous special reading, whether the
saints whose names they exhibit had or had not been honoured with
the splendid solemnities ol a festum in times preceding the pontificate
ol Gregory the Great; or whether, ii so, the continuity of the cultus of
any one oi them had or had not been severed at the time oi St
Augustine's mission to our island. l will, therefore, venture to examine
them one by one, in the hope oi finding answers to these queries. The
titles are 2-

‘De sancto Valentino martyre,’ at sol. 803 ‘De sancto Georgio,'
at iol. 85 v.; ‘De sancto Stephano episcopo,' at iol. 1073 ‘De sancto
Agapito martyre,' at sol. 1123 ‘De sancta Sabina,’ at iol. 115 v'.; ‘De
sancto Eustachio,’ at sol. 129v.; ‘De sancto Theodoro martyre,' at
sol. 1303 ‘De sancta Cecilia,' at iol. 132 o.

The claim in behalf oi a Roman fotum in honour oi St George 'at so
early an era as the pontificate oi Gregory the Great is flimsy indeed;
sor the Bollandists advance no stronger evidence in proot' os it than the
fact that the first portion ol Pamelius's edition oi a nium-century missal
contains a mass in honour ol the warrior-saint So it does But it also
contains masses lor the least oi St Mary of the Martyrs, and ior other
anniversarios which necessitate rei are post-Gregorian. St Gregory does,
it istrue, mention an ‘ecclesia sancti Georgii' in one oi his letters¹3 but,
as'the Bollandists themselves very properly remark, the context ol the
passage proves the building not to have been in or even near Rome, and
the reference has no bearing on the present question.

The lact is that neither the acephalous document known as the
Leonian Sacramentary (which, however, preserves only a part oi its
