Roman form, but that St Gregory replaced it by ‘uocem' when pre·
paring the first edition of the Antiphonary. (2) Finding, however, that
‘orationem' was not easily to be eradicated from the minds and hearts
of his people, he yielded to the prejudice in its favour when preparing
the second edition and let it ligure in the Offertory and also in the
new Alleluia Verse. (3) But, when he came to edit his Antiphonary for
the third tirne, though he could not control the popular singing of the
Offertory, he could control the execution of the Alleluia Verse by his
cantors, and required from these what he could not exact from the
crowd, the rendering which he preferred. ⁴

Whatever may be thought of this explanation, it is a very noteworthy
fact that a conflict between ‘uocem’ and ‘orationem' does seem to
have subsisted in Rome down to comparatively modern times; for the
‘Psalmista secundum consuetudinem Romanae curiae' published, as it
would appear, under Dominican auspices in or about the year 1490, reads
‘uocem,' whilst the Horae Diuinae published by Cardinal the Duke of
York when archpriest of the Vatican basilica has ‘orationemf

The interest of the last instance in Class A is enhauced by the fact
that it occurs in the officim for the Feast of SS. Fabian and Sebastian.

Origen in the H exapla notes at Ps. 11, v. 2 (‘quoniam defecit sanctus’)
two competing Greek words, dsyvds and ὅσιος, at Ps 78, v. 2 (‘ carnes
sanctorum tuorum ') ὁσίων and ἁγνῶν, at Ps. 88, v. 20 (‘locutus es in
uisione sanctis tuis ’) ἁγίοις, υἱοῖς and προφήταιςι. St Jerome must have
been cognisant of these various readings. When, then, he says of this
last passage, in his letter ‘Ad Sunniam 'et Fretellam,' ‘in κοινῇ tantum'
pro sancte filios repperi,’ 1 cannot help thinking that he may have
confounded the passage with some other in which the reading of κοινή
stood by itself, for υἱοῖς is in this place no stranger to the known MSS.
of the Septuagint Be that as it may, the variants just noted prove it to
be in the highest degree likely that our conflicting ‘sanguinem seruorum
tuorum' and ‘sanguinem sanctorum tuorum’ represent two Greek

readings, and are therefore an instance, not of Hieronymian mmdotio,
but of Hieronymian correctrb. ' '

Assuming, then, that ‘sanguinem seruorum tuorum’ was the reading
os the first edition, either because St Gregory knew of no other or
because he believed-as well he might-that it was Hieronymian, how
carne he in the second edition to replace it by ‘sanguinem sanctorum
tuorum’? An answer may, l think, be found in the political cir-
