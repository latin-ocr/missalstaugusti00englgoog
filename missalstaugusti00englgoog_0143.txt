by Gregory the Great when legislating lor the Church oi the English
was not, specifically, the pentecostal week itseli, nor yet,· specifically, the
following week; but the plena hebdomada, or open iortnight, intervening
between Whitsunday and the Sunday next aiter the Octave os Whit·
sunday; and this is precisely the place assigned to it in the Corpus MS.
as written by the transcriber, where the jejunial group follow the six
lerial masses appropriated to Whitsun·week and precede that lor the
First Sunday aiter the Octave ol Pentecost‚ being headed by a title
peculiar to themselves, but a title withal which does not say whether
they are to be used on the first weelr or the second, or on either as
circumstances may require.

I gravely question whether any other book but ours be in existence
which deals thus with the masses oi the summer ember-week; but,
however that may be, no more lelicitous prool than this agreement ol
the Corpus MS. with Egbert’s account ol Gregory the Great’s provision
lor the Church ol the English could reasonably be desired in at·
testation ol the claim ol the Corpus MS. to exhibit the text oi the
Missal described by Egbert as embodying that specific piece ol legis-
lation. He certainly seems to speak ol some peculiar provision pur·
posely made lor the church in our land, or, at any rate, oi a certain use
which, intentionally or unintentionally, had corneto be its peculiar pos· ’
session. Can it have occurred to him to guess how Gregory had
contrived to engrait it into the missals he sent to England? The great
pontifi had done it by the same sort oi artifice as that employed by him
on the opening masses ol the Proprium de Tempore. Let me describe
it as briefly as I can.

Here, as in other instances, the masses previously assigned to the
three summer ember-iasts had been those which we now find in
Pamelius. But Gregory converted them lrom ember masses into lerial
by restricting the number ol Orationes in the first and third to one only.
He at the same time introduced into his book, and under a separate
heading, a group os new ember masses, that lor Wednesday having two
Orationes, that ior Saturday having six.

All this he evidently did. But the question now arises, When did he
doit? It shall be answered presently.

This, at least, he evidently did. But another question follows, Was
this all that he did? Unless I misunderstand Archbishop Egbert's
account, that prelate describes St Gregory as having introduced rffcr'a
lor the summer ember-days into the Antiphonary ior the special behool
ol the Church ol the English, or, at any rate, on the occasion oi his
