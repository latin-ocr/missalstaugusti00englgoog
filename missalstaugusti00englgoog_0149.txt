that they stop short with the twenty-second Sunday after the Octave

of Pentecost, although we should have expected to find the ‘Dicit .

Dominus Ego cogito’ assigned to the twenty-third, and even to the
twenty-fourth as well. But, although these two Sundays are left
unprovided, we do find the ‘Dicit Dominus Ego cogito' attributed to
the twenty-fifth Sunday. li, however, we turn to the palimpsest
insertions for light and information we find on the twenty-third Sunday
the efficium ‘Dicit Dominus Ego cogit0'3 then on the twenty-fourth a
very beautiful οβῑείπνη, ‘Sperent in te,' not to be found, so far as 1 am
aware, anywhere else ; and then a week later the ‘Dicit Dominus Ego
cogito,’ but this time under a form which leaves no doubt that it is of
non-Gregorian derivation.

The circumstance l have just mentioned raises a presumption that
- the attribution of the ‘Dicit Dominus Ego cogito' to the twenty-fifth
Sunday is unauthentic, and that this antiphonarial indication, like that
for the following Sunday, like that for the eighteenth of the post-
pentecostal group, like that for the second in Lent, like others which l
need not now enumerate, was taken, not from the original liber massalis,
but from some other book3 in other words, that, whilst the mass is
authentic‚ the antiphonarial indication appended to its title is of alien
derivation. .

If this be so, it almost inevitably follows that, although St Augus·
tine’s copy of his master's Antiphonary may have contained the ‘Dicit
Dominus Ego cogito’ assigning it to the twenty-third Sunday, and the
‘Sperent in te' assigning it to the twenty-fourth, the corresponding
masses in his copy of his masters Missal presented no intimation of
the fact; in other words, that Gregory‚ notwithstanding his care to
complete the equipment of his masses with antiphonarial indicatione,
wittingly or unwittingly left two, and only two, of the long tale un·
equipped, namely the antepenultimate and the penultimate of the post-
pentecostal group,

Now, if in a previous chapter I was right in believing St Gregory to
have exscinded upon an afterthought the mass ‘Deus refugium nos·
trum‚' which had hitherto stood last but one in the group, a very
plausible account may be given of the missing indications by (i) sup-
posing the leaf on which the ‘Deus refugium nostrum’ began to bave
contained the ‘Largire quaesumus' and the ‘Familiam tuam'3 by (ii)
supposing that Gregory‚ when re-writing these on a new leaf, left blank
spaces alter their respective titles pending a change he contemplated
in the Antiphonary, the change which introduced the officium ‘Sperent
