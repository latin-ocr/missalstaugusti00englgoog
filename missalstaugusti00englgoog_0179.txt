‘chartula' or a ‘libellus’; but since, equally with the book of variable
prayers, it was the depository ot' a sacred formula, it was a ‘sacra-
mentarium' In the eighth century Pope Zachary, when consulted by
St Bonilace as to the places in the text oi the canon at which he was
to make the sign of the cross, sent him arorulusdulymarked13 and when,
in the eleventh century, a portrait ol St Anselm was drawn repre·
senting him seated on a cathedra, wearing all the eucharistie oma-
menta and holding the crosier in his hand, two monks were depicted
in attendance on him, one ol whom held a book and the other a scroll.
The book-so at least it seems t0 me-is the ‘liber sacramentorum,' the
scroll or rotulus is the ‘canon missae'; each os them was a ‘sacra-
mentarium!

Contemporaneously with St Anselm, Abbot Desiderius ol Monte
Cassino provided a set ol necessary books lor the altar os his church,
which are particularly described in the ‘'Chronicon Casinense’:-‘ Fecit
ante faciem altaris tabulam auream...necnon et turibulum...Librum quo-
que epistolarum ad missam describi iaciens tabulis, aurea una altera
uero argentea, decorauit. Codicem etiam regulae beati Benedicti...ar·
gento uestiuit Similiter fecit et de sacramentariis altaris uno et altero,
et duobus nichilominus euangeliis et epistolario uno. Nam usquead
illud tempus in plenario missali tam euangelia quam epistolaelege·
bantur, quod quam esset tunc inhonestum modo satis aduertitur. ld·
ipsum lecit et de alio libello in quo sunt orationes processionales Fecit
et libellum ad cantandum in gradu, siue ante altare, eumque tabulis
eburneis mirifice sculptis et argento ornatis annexuit¹.'

1. He made, that is to say, (1) an altar frontal ot' gold, (2) a
thurible ol the same metal, and (3) an epistle·book which he covered
with silver and gold.

ΙΙ. He covered with silver (Ι) a Rule ol St Benedict‚ (2, 3) a first
and a second‘ sacramentarium altaris} (4, 5) two gospel· books, (6) one
epistle· book—tlte pleimry missal berirg now withdrawn from use-(Da
book of processional prayers.

111. He made a gradual which he covered with 1v0ry and silver.

This systematized classification explains precisely what it was that
he did on the suppression os the plenary missal. Two gospel-books
