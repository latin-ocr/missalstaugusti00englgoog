At fol. 27 u, lin. 11, and, again, at fol. 33, lin. 7, our ‘famulemur,' as
contrasted with ‘seruiamus,' gives a new version of the prayer ‘Concede
q. o. d. utqui protectionis tuae' dec, and brings it into beautiful and
striking conformity with the analogous ‘Protector noster aspice Deus'

It is when dealing with a composition like the latter that one most
keenly regrets the loss of a portion of the Verona book Were that
document complete, we should know whether its ‘Protector noster’
ended with ‘famulemur' or with ‘semiamus’3 for it certainly is a
remarkable fact that, although the extant portion of the precious codex
exhibits two instanees of ‘libera mente seruire‚’ it has none of ‘libera
mente famulari' If, then, ‘libera mente famulari' were found to bea
phrase foreign to the whole of the Verona document, we might argue that
Gregory the Great had recourse to it in the ‘Protector noster’ at an
early stage of his editorial labours, because in his view ‘libera mente
seruire’ was too harshly paradoxical for the conditions of a legitimate
antithesis3 and, we might further argue that, although ‘liberati...seruia·
mus’ did not offend his taste as a latinist, he may yet, on making a later
review of the prayer ‘Concede q. o. d.,’ have seen theological reasons for
preferring ‘liberati...famulemur.’ It, certainly, is curious that both the
‘Protector noster’ and the ‘Concede quaesumus' comprise the three
ideas of protection, freedom and service3 but that the textos our book
is the only text which effects the complete parallelism of the two
prayers by setting over against the ⁸protector...libera...famulemur' of
theone the ‘protectionis...liberati...famulemur' of the othere

Taking leave, however, of ineffectual regrets like these, let us enquire
which, if either, of the two words ‘seruire' and ‘famulari’ has the
support of prae-Gregorian usage, so far as that usage is cognizable by
us; and, then, which of them, if either, may be said to represent the
mature and ultimate choice of Gregory the Great, as Gregory the Great
in his character of latinist and theologian is revealed to us in the
‘Moralia'

The evidence of the Verona book as to the praeGregorian use of
‘famulari' and ‘seruire' and of their cognate substantives‚ is very
interesting.

Notwithstanding the abundant precedent for the use of ‘seruus' to
be found in Holy Scripture (⁴ liberati a peccato serui autem facti Deo,'
Rom. vi. 22; ‘Domino Christo seruite,’ Col. iii. 243 δια, dre) there is not,
