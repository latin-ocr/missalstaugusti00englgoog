When, in the eleventh century, Bemo, monk ol St Gallen and subse·
quently Abbot os Reichenau, says, writing oi the latter house, ‘In nostri
quoque monasterii archiuo habetur missalis longe aliter ordinatus quam
Romanae Ecclesiae se habeat usus¹,’ we feel assured that the book he
means was nota mere ‘liber sacramentorum' like that of Musaeus, the
analysis of which, as given by Gennadius, excludes all idea oi either
‘ordo' or canon ; and it is on the first page oi a ‘liber missalis’ not oi a
‘liber sacramentorum: that he finds a rubric on the Roman use oi the
‘Gloria in excelsis¹.' When, again, in the ninth century Abbot Hilduin,
oi St Denis, wrote to the Emperor oi the ‘antiquissimi et nimia pene
uetustate consumpti missales libri continentes missae ordinem more
Gallico qui ab initio receptae fidei usu in hac occidentali plaga est
habitus usque quo tenorem quo nunc utitur Romanurn susceperit⁸,' he
referred to books containing ritual directions such as do not seem to be
presupposed in any extant description oi a ‘liber sacramentorum?

The Agnellus whose ‘liber missalis’ 1 have just cited opens the
Prologue ot' his Liber Pontificalis thus :—‘ Vobis rogantibus ordinatum
libellum de ordine pontificalis successionis pontificum qui sedern sancti
Apollinaris nutriuerunt⁴,' &c where the characteristic oi a ‘liber ordi-
natus' is a careiully digested series of successive parts. And, similarly,
the three passages just quoted seem to prove that it was oi the essence
of a ‘liber missalis’ that it should contain, besides the contents of a
‘liber sacramentorum} all that went to constitute an ‘ordo missae,’ the
canon, oi course, included

The word ‘sacramentarius' seems to have been a generic phraseos
loose and variable meaning ; and may even have included books like the
Verona MS, a document which can scarcely have been intended for use
at the altar. Thus, it would differ from ‘sacramentorium' or ‘sacra-

mentarium' which meant one or other of the two liturgical documents
used at the altar-the ‘liber sacramentorum’ and the canon-or else, at
least in Germany, a book composed oi both⁶.

As the parchment containing the canon was rolled together, iolded
flat or arranged as a book, it was described accordingly as a ‘rotulus' a
