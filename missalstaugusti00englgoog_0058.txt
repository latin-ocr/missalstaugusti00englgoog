Rome and srom Rome to Canterbury. No one who, uniting in himself
the qualifications ol theologian, scholar and critic, might happen to
examine three competing phrases like the following would fail to suspect
that the order in which 1 here place them is not their true chronological
sequence :—‘ Filius tuus unitam sibi nostrae fragilitatis substantiam in
gloriae tuae dextera collocauit,' ‘Filius tuus unitam sibi fragilitatis
nostrae substantiam in g. td. c.,' ‘Filius tuus unitum sibi hominem
nostrae substantiae in g. t d. c.’ His theologica} instincts would
clamour against the third os them; and, having set it first in order
os time, he would soon surmise the proper relative places ol the
other two:—

UNITUMSIBIHOMINEMNOSTRAESUBSTANTIAE
UNITAMSIBIFRAGILl'l'ATISNOSTRAESUBSTANTIAM
UNITAMSIBINOSTRAEFRAGILITATISSUBSTANTIAM

Even in the middle ol a line it would be no hard thing to fit
an uncial ‘fragilitatis' into the space occupied at first by an uncial
‘hominem' and that without any undue crowding; whilst the change ol
‘fragilitatis nostrae' into ‘nostrae fragilitatis} so as to place ‘sibi' and
‘nostrae’ side by side, would be the exquisite improvement os a later
review, perhaps ol a fresh transcripti0n¹. So we reason a priori; nor
are we wrong. The Verona book (lx. vi.) gives the Communicantes lor

Ascension-Day with the remarkable reading ‘unitum sibi hominem
nostrae substantiae²,’ the Gregorian texts hitherto printed have the next
best reading3 ours is the best ol all.

Here, then, as in so many other instances‚ we are, Ι think, justified in
saying, that ol two rival readings set against the prae-Gregorian lection
ours is in all probability the later, as it is in all certainty the better.

The ninth typical instance, at sol. 5421, lin. 11, resembles the
first in that the authorized Roman Missal agrees with the Corpus MS. as
against other editions. But I think it in a high degree likely that its
‘efficiat’ isan editorial substitution, and that the authentic reading ol
the parent manuscripts ol the Roman Missal was ‘perficiat'

All the constituents ol our mass lor the Tuesday in Whitsun·week are
represented in the Verona fragment :—‘ Adsit nobis d. q. uirtus spiritus
sancti quae et corda nostra clementer expurget et ab omnibus tueatur
aduersis [in place os the Veronese inimicis] per...eiusdem [only ‘Per'
in Verona book]. ⁴ ¹

¹ Compare the transposed ⁴ offeramus' in instance 1v ol the present group.
² Compare with this the primitive reading ol a clause ol the Te Deum-‘Tu ad liberandum

mundum suscepisti homiuem)
