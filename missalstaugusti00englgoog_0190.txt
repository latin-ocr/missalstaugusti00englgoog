V. Now, let us watch the amanuensis as, directed by St Gregory, he
transfers from the five affected leaves of the working copy to seven of
blank clean vellum (i) so much of the text as is to remain as it had been,
(ii) then the three ferialized masses, (iii) thirdly‚ the experimentally
written triad of ember masses, and, lastly, so much of the post-pentecostal
text as has to be re·written; inserting, however, at its proper place,
the textual compensation which 1 bave just mentioned. This com-
pensation Ι believe to have consisted of the Antiphona and Psalm of
the Whitsunday mass.

The seven new leaves, then, were filled as follows :-

The first of their fourteen pages carried on its first three lines the
indication ’.Ᾱ Spiritus domini repleuit orbem terrarum. alleluia. Ps.
Omnium est enim? Then followed the Whitsunday mass. After this
carne the five ferial masses, preceded, respectively, by the indications
‘Cibauit eos ex adipe,' ‘Accipite' ‘Spiritus domini‚' ‘Spiritus domini‚'
‘Karitas dei,' this last being followed by ‘Domine Deus salutis‘; and
‘Mentes nostras’ serving as Oratio for the third mass All this filled
six pages, the aggregate amount being, in terms of letters, 53 ÷4o÷ 336
4274÷379÷426÷413÷295 (=2216)=120><18f,; or (23÷15†21
÷23÷22†16=)120 lines.

At the head of the seventh page stood the title ‘IN IEIUNIO-nuff-
TEMPORUM! Then followed the ‘Gelasian’ triad of ember masses, each
with its proper antiphonarial indication. All now was easy work
enough until, the last of the Saturday Orationes being written, the
pontiff and his underling observed that there remained too many lines
before them, instead of too few, for prayers so brief as the proper
accessories of the ‘Deus qui tribus pueris! St Gregory, therefore, had
recoursc to the ‘Gelasian' collection, and took back thence Saturday's
Secreta and Postcommunion, thus producing a hybrid mass, just as be
had done some months ago on the joint feast of SS. Fabian and
Sebastiam and in his single mass for St Laurence’s Day¹.

All that it now remained for the clerk to do was to copy linc for
line, and on corresponding lines of the last leaf of the seven, so much
of the first post-pentecostal mass as stood on the last of the affected
leaves of his master's working book—to copy it, but with a most
important change in the title. The title had been

DOMINICA'·I·POST PENTECOSTEN
lt was now to be

DOM1N1cn·1·Pos'r0'c‘T·PENTEco's'T.
