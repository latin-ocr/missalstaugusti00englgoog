IN TRODUCTION. 1:⁸⁶*

93 v.), a mass which seems to have had no existence before the pontificatis
of Theodore (ΑΛ). 642-649)¹. The terminus cxci quem sor the completion
of the primitive book may thus be set slightly before the middle of the
seventh century. lt is from that date forward that we encnunter that
series of verbal errors which we have found to cuntrast st] strangely with
the textual purity os such of the masses uf thr: Corpus MS. as are
known to be of Gregorian redaction.

ΙΙ. · The earliest instance of inconsistent titulatinn is *De san-:tn
Valentino' (fol. 80). This cannot reasonably be assigned to an earlier
date than the year 626².

111. The monks os St Augustine’S, Canterbury, seem tn have
recognized and perpetuated from a very early date that diverse titulation
of the primary and secondary os two concurring [nasses which we note in
such cases of concurrence as are to be found in Roman masses old
enough to have been edited by St Gregory²⁵; and the differe-nee is the
more remarkable from the fact that titles relating tn saints who had no
official connexion with the monastery are always cast in the ablativa·
case. None, that is to say, of our national saints have :nasses with
genitive-case titles save (1) archbishops of Canterbury, in reg-*ard ns whom
the owners os the book claimed it as a right that they should bury them
within their precinct, (2) abbots of their own house, and (3) abbesses of
St Mildred’s, a monastery for women, the counterpart of their own.

Our book assigns masses to seven of the first ten primates, Arch-
bishops of Canterbury buried at St Augustine¹s : thus,—

fol. 92. ‘In uigilia festiuitatis sancti Augustini Anglorurn apostoli*

fol. 92 v. ‘ ln die! (4- 605).

fol. 78 v. ‘ De sancto Laurentio pontifice? (ψ 619).

fol. 86. ‘ In festiuitate sancti Melliti archiepiscopi? (÷ 624).

fol. 130 v. ‘ In festiuitate sancti Iusti archiepis-:opis [4- 635).

fol. 12 3 v. ‘ De sancto Honorio archiepiscopo? (4- fi 5 3).

fol. 102 v. ‘ In festiuitate sancti Deusdedit archiepiscopi? (4- 554).

fol. 120. ‘ Sancti Theodori archiepiscopi.³ (-Ι- 690).

H'ow is it, then, that the names of two out of these seven are in the
ablative case? Unquestionably, because the anniversary of one uf them,
St Laurence‚ concurred with the feast of· the Purisscatiom and that of
the other, St HonoriuS, with a solemnity to which Ι must now call the

attention os my readers, Archbishop Honorius died on the thiu-tietb ns
September in the year 653.
