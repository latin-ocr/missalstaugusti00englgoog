Pp. xxxii, xxxiii, footnotes For ‘Sottemuee’ read ‘Sotterranea.'

P. xl, line 26. The mutiously worded sentence, ‘On the other hand,I do not think: &c
must be very greatly modified. I hed not registered the insunces in which the Verona book
employu ‘pertinere ed' in the usual sense, end wrote from e casuel memorandum. Hence the
fnlse reference, ‘xL111.iv.'for ‘xnu iv.,' und ‘pertinere’ for ‘pertinuisse’ During the passage

boolr hes ‘pertinere ed’ in the usual sense. It may be well to apprise the reeder that euch of
them is in a Prefuce. The references in Balleriui are xr11.iv.,xvn.vii., xvur. ri, xvia.
