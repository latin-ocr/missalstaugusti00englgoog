Similarly, our ‘oblationibus nostris' at fol. 30 v, lin. 17, is in such
admirable balance with the contextual ‘nostras etiam rebelles uolun-
tates' as to render it morally certain that this reading was meant to be
an improvement on the mere ‘Oblationibus' which has been perpetuated
by, l believe, all previous editions with the exception of the Pio
Clementine Missal and its precursors¹.

Nor can there be a doubt that the ‘Sumpti domine sacrificii’ at fol
3 3, lin. 2, in the Postcommunion for the Friday after Passion·Sunday, is
preferable to ‘Sumpti sacrificii domine' lt is the sort of improvement
that might be expected in a transcription following upon a leisurely
review by the compiler.

The final ‘repellat' in the same prayer is not only in keeping with
the ‘relinquat’ which ends the first half of the sentence', but has the
support ol ‘cunctam repelle nequitiam’ at fol 22 u, lin. 2.

The Postcommunion ‘Per huius domine operationem mysterii' &c
occurs four times in the Corpus MS.; its second verb being ‘compleantur'
in three instances, and in one instance ‘impleantur’; a variation common
to one 2ηά all of the editions. But, while other sacramentanes have in
every case ‘purgentur’ for their first verb, the Corpus MS. stands alone
in giving, not ‘purgentur,' but ‘curentur' at fol. 3321, lin. 2ο; thus,—
‘Per huius domine operationem mysterii et uitia nostra curentur et iusta
desideria compleantur? l think the right explanation of the difference
to be, simply, this; that the prayer in question, lilce several still extant in
the Verona book, was a sort of common-place occurring over 2ηά over
again under varying forms; and that the form which happened to recur to
the memory, or to meet the eye, of Gregory or of his amanuensis while
engaged upon the archetype of our volume happened in this particular
instance to be the form containing ‘curentur' The other instances occur
at fol. 1511, lin. 8, and fol. 106, lin. 8, where the verbs are ‘purgentur...
compleantur: and at fol 23, lin. 14, where we find ‘purgentur...im·
pleantur.'

The extant portion of the Verona book leaves no doubt that both
‘curare' and ‘purgare' are of prae-Gregorian use in the connexion
exhibited by the prayer before us. Witness the following, ‘Concede
nobis...ut quicquid in nostra mente uitiosum est...curetur’ (XL vii.) and
‘Sacris caelestibus...uitia nostra purgentur’ (x.).

The ‘incessanter’ at fol. 3421, lin. 9 must now engage our attention.
