xxiv INTRODUCTION.

under the pontificate os Leo 111, mention is made oi the ‘diaconia S.

Eustachii! One oi their manuscripts (‘Florarium nostrum MSJ) says
that at one time his feast was kept on the twentieth oi September, but
that it was moved to the second ol November in memory oi some trans·
lation oi his relies ; but they add, ‘De qua autem hic translatione sermo
sit hactenus reperire non potui. Crassissimis tenebris involuta sunt
quaecunque de SS. Eustathii et sociorum sacris exuuiis ante tempora
Coelestini 111, qui anno Christi 1196 sancta corpora Romae inspexit,
reiemntur¹.'

St Agapitus was not a Roman martyr, nor can 1 find that the Roman
church paid him any kind oi honour before the ninth century, when,
according to the Liber Pontificalis (5 415), Pope Leo Ill. ‘sarta tecta
basilicae...in urbe Praenestina, necnon et sarta tecta alterius basilicae
iuxta eandem basilicam sitae, quae iam prae nimia uetustate ruitura
erant, omnia nouiter in melius restaurauit’

The same authority (ᾖ 65) informs us that a church bearing the name
oi St Sabina was built in the city oi Rome during the pontificate oi
Sixtus 111. (n.1).432-440) by a bishop os the name os Peter; whilst
others reier the erection to the pontificate oi Celestine 1. (11.1). 42 3—432),
and make Peter not a bishop, but a priest Martinelli, however, in his
‘Roma Sacra,’ while allowing the church to have been built in 425 by
Peter, whom he calls a cardinal, declares that it was erected in place of
an earlier structure by that time destroyed.

As to Sabina herself, the martyrologies oi Ado and Usuard give
Rome as the seat oi her cultus But, true though it be that this was so
at the comparatively late period oi the compilation ol those works, it is
by no means clear that there had been no confusion oi the Aventine
Hilt, on which there then stood a church bearing the name oi St Sabina,
with the oppidum Vindinense which the Acta recorded as the scene oi St
Sabina's martyrdom ; forthere is exceedingly good authority sor believ-
ing the Aventine Hill and the oppidum Vindinense not to have been
identical places, 3ηά ior asserting that the only real oppidum Vindinense
was a town in Umbria. To Tillemont¹, who presses this point with
acuteness and vigour, the Bollandists make an ineffectual rejoinder⁸
which it is needless to discuss. When, however, they proceed to say
‘nec ulla translationis fit mentio in Actis aut Martyrologiis’ they point,
unwittingly enough, to a plausible solution ol the difficulty, namely
