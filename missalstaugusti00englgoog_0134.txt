cxviii INTRODUCTION.

Clementine, and to which the Azevedian missal would seem to bc re·
ferable, may be notified as Redaction C. By Redaction D 1 understand
that outcome of editorial ellort from which, as from its proper source,
was derived the liber mt‘ssalis which Augustine and his monks brought
with them to our shores in the year 597. For l believe St Augustine’s
liber missales to have been a modification of that document

lt is obvious that the differences by which a later edition ol a work
is distinguished irom an earlier may be introduced into the document in
the course oi a review prior to transcription, or in the course oi the
transcription itseli. But it is obvious that, even though the editorial
achievement be perfect, sufficient, satisfactory oi the editor’s lull in-
tention, the editor himself may, alter the new archetype has leit his
hands, see fit to call it back in order to introduce into it some change or
changes too specific in themselves and too limited in their scope to
justily him in calling the resultant by the name oi a new edition. Hence
my reason ior speaking oi the Canterbury original as a sub-redaction
oi the prototype which lor convenience' sake l denominate by the
letter D.

For, curiously enough, the several groups oi neighbouring prayers os
which Ι spoke in my last chapter¹ as constituting an important differenoe
between the constituent text of the Corpus MS. and that os sacra-
mentaries os the Pamelian type have, one and all oi them, a sticho·
metrical characteristic which goes to prove that they are the outcome oi
a manipulation oi the prototype aiter the prototype had issued fresh in
its charms os caresul script and comely rubrication irom the papal
scriptorium.

Let us begin, then, with the group oi changes comprised in the first
nine masses os the book, and tabulate their textual value in terms oi
letters The substituted Oratio and Postcommunion in the mass for
Advent Sunday yield an increment oi some 170 letters; on Christmas·
Eve a Secreta os 104 letters is replaced by one ol 183 ; whilst two new
Prefaces contribute between them new text ol the value of 435 letters.

· 'she aggregate of these augmentations approximates so closely to the

double of a figure already made familiar to us that our curiosity and
interest are aroused, and we bethink ourselves oi the twice nineteen
letters in excess oi the average yieldcd by the antiphonal indications²
and oi the 24 letters of the clause ‘aduenienti’ &c.⁸; and wc lind, to our
mingled amazement and delight, that the result is as iollows :- ’
