that, as regards at least one particular—the time for observing the
ember·fast of the summer quanter-the evidence os which he was
cognizant had been contributed by two or more copies ol it, and
also by two or more copies oi the antiphonary consultcd by him at

The present is the proper moment sor making two remarks as to
certain details ol the ensuing essay on MS. C. C. C. C. 270 :-

1. 1· use ‘verbal text’ as a convenient phrase lor the several words
ol which a prayer or other composition is made up ; ‘constituent text'
lor the several prayers or other components os a mass; and ‘structural

· text' sor the several masses contained in the document under review,

in respectos their number, their order and their external characteristics.

11. My essay is the outcome ol a minute analysiS, in the course os
which I have collated the verbal and the constituent text of the
document with those ol sacramentaries or missals already printed and
claiming to be Gregorian. The books used were as follows :-

1. Jusserand's reprint os Angelo da Rocca’s edition of a Liber
Sacramentorum preserved in the Vatican Library. Da Rocca was
Presect ot the Apostolic Sacristy in the pontificate os Clement v111.‚
and published his work in the year 1597.

2. The Abbe Migne’s reprint (Patrologia, Series Latina, tom. 78) ol
Dom Hugues Menard's edition os the ‘Missale Sancti Eligii,' a volume
now preserved iu the Bibliotheque Nationale iu Paris. Menard's work
was published in 1642, and was dedicated to Cardinal Richelieu.

The two documents are in many essential respects identical.

3. The ‘Sacramentomm Libri Tres' forming part ol the well·
known collection bearing the general title os ‘Liturgia Latinorum lacobi
Pamelii Canonici Brugensis, S. Theologias Licentiati, duobus tomis
digesta’ I have worked on the edition published at Cologne in 1 5 71.

4. A similar document comprised in Muratori's ‘Liturgia Romana
Vetus'—‘Liturgia Romana Vetus...edente Ludovico Antonio Mura-
torio.’ My copy was published at Venice in the year 1748.

5. Differing in many respects lrom each os these two groups of
two is the ‘Vetus Missale Romanum’ edited by the Jesuit Emmanuel
d'Azevedo from a neglected manuscript found by him at the Lateran.
He dedicated his work to Benedict XIV. My copy os it was published
at Rome in the year 1754

6. The ‘Missale Romanum' in general use, sometimes mentioned
as the Pio-Clementiae. My copy is dated Mechlin, 1850.
