INTRODUCTION. lxvii

ln the Verona book 1 find live instances ol ‘incessabiliter,' and
five of ‘sine cessatione,' but no fewer than forty·one ol ‘iugiter’;
whilst ‘indesinenter’ seems to occur but four times and ‘incessanter’
only twice Α- much larger number ol instances might, possibly,
enable us to detect some intrinsic divergence ol signification between
the prae-Gregorian ‘incessanter' and the prae-Gregorian ‘indesinenter';
but the sew we have yield none. l do find, however, that the Ι
context may have had something to do with the choice ol one or
other word, lor the Verona book uses ‘incessanter’ only in malam
partem and ‘indesinenter’ exclusively in bonam partem (‘ incessanter
offendit( xv111. xv.; ‘incessanter offendimus,' xxltc xv.; ‘indesinenter
celebrare,'v[11. xxvii.; ‘quas [benedictiones] indesinenter expectant‚’
xtv. iv., xvl. xvii. 3 ‘piis operibus indesinenter exerce‚' xv111. xlv).
Assuming, therefore, that the text found by earlier editors is one
exhibiting but a partial castigation ol prae-Gregorian phraseology‚ it
may be in obedience to this distinction that, while in the Post·
communion lor the Friday alter Midlent Sunday they find, as do
we, ‘a propriis reatibus indesinenter expediat‘ their reading ol the
prayer with which we are just now concerned is,-‘ Praesta q. o. d.
ut qui nostris excessibus incessanter affligimur per unigeniti tui passi-
onem liberemur.’

But, when we turn to Gregory the Great we find no such ethic
difference between his ‘indesinenter' and his ‘incessanten’ His flame
ol charity rises indesinenter from its altar (xxv, vii.) and his wicked
indesinenter go from bad to worse (XXIV. xxiii); whilst his just men
thirst incensanter lor the joys ol heaven (xxx, xvi.) and his sinners
corrupt themselves incessanter (xxv, x.) by their evil ways. But, on the
other hand, we do find a very remarkable divergence os grammatica}
signification between the two words

The radical distinction observed by him between ‘indesinenter' and
‘incessanter’ would seem to be the sort os distinction which obtains
between unceasing continuity and unvaried recurrence Thus, he says
that ‘uita indesinenter labitur'(v11L xi), and that ‘sol indesinenter
cursum suum peragit' (xl. l.). But, to quote the first ol two passages
just now alluded to, when he says that the just ‘incessanter accenduntur
ut sitiant, sitiunt ut satientur,' he seems to choose his adverb with the
express purpose os indicating the unvarying altemation and inter·
dependence os the two states described. ln the second ol them there
can be uo doubt that this is his design ;-‘ Saepe contingit ut per hoc
quod nequiter uiuunt et illud perdant quod salubriter credunt. Inces-
