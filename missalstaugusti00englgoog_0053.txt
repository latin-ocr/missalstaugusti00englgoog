there reason to believe that ‘pertinere' was a word he would be likely to
discard, and ‘peruenire' a word he would be likely to put in its place?
Or, considerations of likelihood being set aside, was there anything in
‘peruenire' to claim his choice in preference whether to ‘pertinere' or
to ‘pertingere'l

In the hope of elucidating this and some other like enquirieS, Ι
have made a careful examination of St Gregory’s latinity in one of
the most voluminous of his treatises, the ‘Moralia in Librum Iob:
None of his works could be more profitably consulted with such a
view; for it is multifarious as well as prolix, and is composed in
some parts in a literary style, in others in a colloquial¹. With regard,
then, to his use of ‘pertinere' ‘peruenire' and ‘pertingere' Ι hnd as
follows :-

He never from end to end of the ‘ Moralia' employs ‘pertinere ad' in
the sense of ‘to attain to,’ ‘to arrive at,' and the like.

But, on the other hand, apart from an occasional employment of the
impersonal ‘pertingitur,' he makes frequent use of ‘peruenire’ and ‘per-
tingere' IfI could feel quite certain that my own index uerbomm was
complete, Ι should say that he uses one word as often as the other in
the sense of ‘to arrive'3 but there can be no doubt that where he is
careful to observe a difference oi meaning he uses ‘pertingere' for the
attainment of a forbidden or improper, and ‘peruenire' for that of a

lawiul and proper, end; or else that he throws more of effort and en· κ

deavour into the former than the latter word, making ‘pertingere ad'
mean ‘to succeed in reaching,' and ‘peruenire ad’ ‘to reach’ When,
for example, he speaks of the wicked man who hopes, but in vain,
fora long life, he says (Moralia, ΧΠ, Ιίἰ.), ‘ad illud tempus peruenire
non ualet quod expectat'3 employing thus the very verb used by him
of those who gain their wish,-‘ Plerumque enim quosdam cemimus
et peruerse agere, et usque ad senectutem ultimam peruenire! But,
of the joys of heaven, which are to be gained, not by passive ex·
pectancy, but by active effort, he says (ib. lx. xxvii), ‘tandiu necesse
est ut quisque se afficiat quousque ad...aeterna gaudia pertingat! The
difference of use, if sometimes slight, is always unmistakeable, so
unmistakeable, indeed, as to assure me that if, of the three competing
forms of the Postcommunion we are considering, there be one which,
in virtue of the evidence of style, can claim to shew trace of the
