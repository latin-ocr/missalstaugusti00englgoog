of the text of No. 1, instead of placing the antiphonarial indication im-
mediately after the capimlum, he writes the minor 'rubric ‘ORATIO' first
3ηά makes the indication follow after.

3. The next case occurs at the 100101 the same page, where, had
the rubricator been at liberty to follow an order 01 things now no longer
in vogue, the title 101 him to write would have been ‘Dominica secunda
post Epiphaniam' But what has he done? Dropping, properly enough,
the ‘secunda’ he 1133 gone on to write, again properly enough, ‘post
octauas Epiphaniae,' but has forgotten to go back and put in the
necessary ‘prima' in the place left 10111.

4 At 101. 17 v, lin. 16 the rubricator, whom I believe to have been
the scribe himself, at home by this time with the changed nomenclature,

very properly wrote ‘Dominica 11· post octauas Epiphaniae’ ;¹ but it
was now the reviser's¹ turn to blunder; for, misled, as it would seem,

by Νο. 1, he 1133 taken the pains to tum ‘·l1·’ into ‘·1l1·.'

5. Α1 101. 18, lin. 15 we come to 3111333 which had no existence in
N 0. 1, a mass, therefore, whose title and whose text must both 01 them
have been taken from Νο. 3. Hence, no doubt, its ‘Dominica ·111·'

instead 01 the ‘Dominica ·1l1· post octauas Epiphaniae' which con·
sistency requires

6. The mass beginning at 101. 70 v, lin. 4 must at one time have
carried the title ‘Dominica ante Aduentum Domini,’ a title which,
on the addition of the comparatively modern mass at 101. 71, was
appropriated by the latter. Again the rubricator, diverted 110111 that
easy concomitancy 01 hand and brain which is all in· all to a copyist, has
quite unconsciously written ‘· xv ·’ instead 01 ⁴ · xxv · .'

These rubrical blunders are 311 the more remarkable from the fact
that one of the marvels 01 the document is its singular accuracy 01
transcription; but morc remarkable are they from the circumstance
that each 01 them occurs 111 close relation with changes and innovations
which are known to be post-Gregorian. Most remarkable 01 311 13 the
fact that there are no such errors to be found in those parts 01 the
Proprium de Tempore where all that the rubricator had to do was to

follow without distraction the lead 01 Νο. 1, No evidence is so telling
as unconscious evidence; and we need have little doubt that the scribe
and the reviser worked on, at least, two documents, one 01 which was
rubricated in conformity with the custom of the age of Gregory the Great

¹ His few marginal notes hare been 01 infinite service to me. l call him par excellence the
reviserr but, when necessary, shall, to distinguish him from others, call him the principa! reviset.
