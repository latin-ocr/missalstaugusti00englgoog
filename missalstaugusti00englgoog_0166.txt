extravagance so great l am obliged, therefore, to conclude that in this
one instance, as in no other, the number of rival readings is, not two, but
three Could we fairly say that in ‘me' and ‘nos’ we have an instance
of correctio, we might see in the successive forms, ‘ut eruas me,' ‘ut
eripias me' and ‘ut eruas nos,’ three out of four combinations of two
distinct pairs of words, and say that our boolr yields no exception to the
rule that competitive readings are never more than two in number. But
that cannot be. Ἰ infer, therefore, that our ‘nos' for ‘me’ is an
arbitrary change of St Gregory's, and, making this inference, encounter
the question, Why? Having in his first and second editions written
‘me,' what made him replace it by ‘nos'l This is the first question 3
and the second is as interesting, Why should Gregory after replacing
‘eruas' by ‘eripias’ revert in the Canterbury boolr to his first reading?
The latter. change was, Ι apprehend, entailed by the first The ex·
traordinary substitution of ‘nos' for ‘me' invited the extraordinary
substitution of ‘eruas' for ‘eripias' The one change is evidence of the
other, and we have the same sort of phenomenon as must often have
been noted in the verbal text of the Missal, the phenomenon of textual
equivalence¹. An uncial ERuAs Nos is as nearly as may be of the same
textual value as an uncial emptas Mtr‘. And, as for the economy of
quotation to which St Gregory persuaded himself to have resort when
he replaced the psalmist’s ‘me’ by ‘nos,' Ι see no satisfactory apology
but that which l have suggested, that it was an appeal er re nata from
the Pontifi to the piety of his floclr and to the mercy of Heaven in a
moment of severe public trial.

l think, then, that we are justified in concluding as follows :-In
instances Ar, A2, A 3, A 5, A7, A9 we have less euphonious readings
in what there is otherwise sufficient reason for regarding as the first
redaction, and more euphonious readings substituted for thern in the
second and retained in the third ; in D10,D2o, D21, D25, D31
less euphonious readings in what purport to be the first and second
redactions, and more euphonious readings substituted for them in the
third ; in D11, as to which Pamelius gives no evidence, a less euphonious
in the second, and a more euphonious in the third. ln Au we have a
less apposite reading in the first, and a more apposite in the second and

¹ Some special attention will be peid to this subject in a later chapter.

¹ The render will please to remember that in the Antiphomry there would be two reasons,
not one, for observing the law of equivalent restitution. An unduly crowded text would not
only offend the eye Being accompauied by confusion in the musical notation, it might involve
the cantors in great trouble.
