PREFACE. V

of this exceedingly minute enquiry‚ an enquiry which would have been
tedious in the extreme but for occasional presages of ultimate success,
is in the following pages distributed over the chapters entitled ‘The
Constituent Text of the two Propria,’ ‘Prototype and Exemplar,’ ‘The
“Plena Hebdomada post Pentecosten ''’ and ‘St Gregory's Working
Copy¹.' When studying these portions of the monograph, my readers
· will observe how very careful was St Gregory’s readjustment of his own
.· work. They will also be ready, 1 am sure, to participate with me the
pleasure of seeing how three several lines of luminous evidence may be
made to converge upon a few cubic feet of hallowed space deep hidden
in the recesses of the catacombs¹.
It was not till 1 had spent several months on the Antiphonary⁸ that
Ι found either courage or occasion for approaching the subject of the
‘plena hebdomada post pentecostem! Nor was it till the greater portion
of the Introduction was already in type that, daring to snatch a photo-
graph of the unseen‚ Ι finally allowed myself to own that St Gregory’s
working copy was the very book which had served as exemplar to the
scribe of the Corpus MS& and, further, that the Corpus ΜΒ. had after
its completion been brought by careful revision into conformity witha
final transcriptos St Gregory's perfected recension⁸.
The faesimiles which the Master and F ellows of Corpus Christi have

’ allowed me to introduce into the present volume will give a truer idea

of the document than any description which Ι might succeed in elabo-
rating. 1 have been careful to note its successive pages, to reproduce
its peculiarities, however faulty, of punctuation and spelling, and, by the
use of italics, to distinguish later work from the pristine text The
spelling of the antiphonarial excerpts may, possibly, be of service to
some future student

Ι desire to acknowledge, and to acknowledge in no perfunctory
terms, the kindness of the Master and Fellows of Corpus Christi in
giving me permission to transcribe this their inestimable treasure, as also
their infinite patience with me during a period of now nearly ten years.
To the Syndics of the University Press Ι owe and offer as sincere a
recognition of the honour done me in associating my name with theirs
