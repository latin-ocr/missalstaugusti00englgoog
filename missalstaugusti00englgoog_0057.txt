made it by a single effort; and yet, most ol the published MSS. put the
verb ol the relative clause into the optative mood, reading ‘significent'
not ‘significant’; whilst others, resenting such a word in such a con-
nexion, replace it by ‘laetificent' or by ‘nobis impendant‚' the latter
variant being accompanied by the conversion os ‘quae' into ‘quaesumus¹.'

The simplest explanation ol all this is, l think, the true one; that
Gregory’s amanuensis, or Gregory himself, or Gregory's first copyist,
accustomed to the optative mood in Secretae, unthinkingly wrote ‘signi-
ficent' sor ‘significant’; and that our ‘significant' is the correction oi a
mere inadvertence.

The seventh instance, at sol. 342¹, lin. 16, is the grammatical converse
os that just considered, lor the Corpus MS. stands alone when on the
Wednesday in Holy·week it reads ‘sint' not ‘suut' in the following
Secreta :—‘ Purifica nos misericors deus, ut aecclesiae tuae preces quae
tibi gratae sint pia munera deserentes liant expiatis mentibus gratiores’
It is true that on the Thursday aster the Fourth Sunday in Lent it has
‘sunt' not ‘sint'3 but the explanation is not iar to seek. The Thursday
masses in Lent, being os post-Gregorian compilation, were taken to
Canterbury in the dress current in the place where they were compiled
or copied, and were incorporated into the sacramentary os St Augustine's
Abbey without alteration.

Now, although it might be rash to call ‘suut’ an absolutely inad-
missible reading in the present connexion, there can be no doubt that
theologians would prefer ‘sint' and that ‘sint' is entirely in accordance
with the ἦθος os this class ol prayers. lndeed,l doubt whether in the
whole oi the vast and multitudinous collection contained iu the Verona

book there be another Secreta besides the present which makes the
laithlul declare their petitions to be acceptable to God, even when
recommended to Him by the accompaniment os the ‘pia munera'! And,
certainly, ii St Gregory may be thought to have exchanged either of the
two words sor the other, we cannot doubt that what he found was ‘sunt'
and what he lelt was ‘siut’ But ‘sunt' as 1 have just intimated, is the
reading ol the Verona book, which (xxlx. iii.) gives us the same text as
do editions prior to the present; with the exception oi ‘sacra munera'
sor ‘pia munera,' but with ‘pia munera' suggested as an alternative.
The eighth instance, at sol 52, lin. 4, like the fifth and sixth, is
one whose history can, l think, be traced by travelling lrom Verona to
