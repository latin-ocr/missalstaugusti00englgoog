Il these carelessnesses are slight, they are without precedent iu the
post-pentecostal group; and if l be right in attributing them to some
disturbing cause acting on an artist ol peculiarly mercurial temperament,
I should suppose that the disturbing cause in the first and second cases
was—in whole or in part-the absence ol an antiphonarial indication in
the exemplar. Be the surmise right or wrong, in each case we have an
‘rt’ followed by nothing3 and it is obvious to infer that there was no
indication in the original. But why not? Because, assuredly, (1) the
suppression of the mass ‘Deus refugium' having involved the re-writing
of its immediate predecessors, (2) although it was Gregory's intention
that each ol them should be provided withan antiphonarial indication,
(3) the insertion of these details was postponed pending some cou-
templated modification oi the Antiphonary.

And when we examine the excerpts what do we find? We find that
an (fficium unknown to the other redactions has been provided for the
twenty-fourth Sunday. We also find that the officium which is made to
do duty sor the twenty-fifth Sunday is marked by blunders which
prove its derivation to be allemand that its insertion had not been
contemplated by the interpolating rubricator, who here, as on the
eighteenth Sunday, a dominica uacans (fol. 67), wrote no capitulum, or
heading¹. This corresponds with the lact that the rubricator ol the
missal itsell has introduced no ‘It’ alter the title ol the mass on fol. 70 v.

These details, besides going to prove, as we have seen on an earlier
page, that the Canterbury original had been manipulated for the
removal ol' the mass ‘Deus refugium' and ol three constituents hitherto
assigned to the Feast ol SS. Fabian and Sebastian, also go to prove
that the new officium, although already contemplated, may not as yet
have been composed.

It is only in inter-related documents that it seems natural and con·
gruous to find coincidences such as these.

A question here arises which, for lack ol adequate material, cannot
be satisfactorily answered. Let me notice itas briefly as may be.

We shall see in an early chapter that one ol the sacramentaries
which St Augustine brought to Canterbury differed from the rest in
being a copy of Redaction D in its transitional condition of modifi-
cation and development into Subredaction D' ; and we shall also see
that there is good prima facie ground lor thinking that one, at least, of
