aliquid expectant Eliu uero alia finiens alia incessanter exorditur [he
no sooner finishes one thing than he begins another] ut immensa loqua-
citas per subiuncta semper initia continuetur'; where it is evident that
‘incessanter' has the force of the French ‘incessamment' in the sense of
‘straightway,¹ or ‘immediately'

Now, it is not true, in fact, that we no sooner transgress God's law
than we suffer for the transgression; nor, in theology, thatin this life
(and the scope of the prayer before us is limited to this life) sin is
imwfflmwfflmmmmmwstmmm
perfectly safe, both in fact and in theology, when we say that so long
as we live our trespasses are a source of afflictior to us

. If, then, in the instance before us either of the two competing words
be a word referable to the correcting pen of Gregory, it is, without doubt,
‘indesinenter¹.'

Our Postcommunion for the Wednesday in Holy Week (fol. 3451.) is
‘Largire sensibus nostris, o. d. ut per temporalem filii tui mortem, quam
mysteria ueneranda testantur, uitam nobis uenisse perpetuam confida-
mus' This ‘uitam nobis uenisse' is represented by ‘uitam te nobis
dedisse' in the authorized Roman Missal, in D'Azevedo, in Menard and
Da Rocca, and in the Venice edition of 1502, that of 1501 reading
‘uitam nobis te dedisse' But Pamelius and Muratori find ‘uitam nobis
ffifflTmmmemmmmeMme,
account is, that the date of ‘uitam nobis dedisse' is proto-Gregorian;
‘uitam te nobis dedisse’ and, possibly, ‘uitam nobis te dedisse' being
post-Gregorian or, at any rate, non-Gregorian attempts at the correction
of a grammatical inaccuracy. And, although it is not impossible that
‘uitam nobis dedisse’ may have been the prae-Gregorian reading, 1
am inclined to class it with the ‘respice’ for ‘suscipe' and the ‘Cunctis'
for ‘A cunctis' which have already engaged our attention, and to
describe it as a clerical error; for it is much harder to think that it
figured in the codar gelasicmus and also that it was allowed to pass
thence into Pope Gregory's first compilation, than to think that the
codargelasriznus had a good reading enough, but that Gregory replaced
it by another, and that the scribe blundered over his instructions
