cxxxiv INTRODUCTION.

in te' into the volume and which made it, not the ‘Dicit Dominus Ego
cogit0‚' the last ol the series standing ready lor repetition if need should
be; and (iiilby further supposing that, alter this change had been eflected
in the Antiphonary, he or his scribe lorgot to turn to the mass-book and
there introduce in the blank spaces that awaited them the phrases
‘Dicit Dominus Ego cogito,’ ‘Sperent in te,’ ‘Sperent in te’ before the
three concluding masses ol the Proprium de Tempore.

To complete the plausibility os this explanation it would, ol course,
be necessary to prove, not only that the mass ‘Deus reiugium' was
exscinded from Redaction D ol St Gregory's Missal asan aiterthought
at some time between the closing ol the papal crypt and the summer
os 596, but that the ‘Sperent in te' was during that interval added to
what lor convenience‘ sake Ι will call the third form oi the Antiphonary.
The first ol these conditions has been fulfilled3 and I hope, in the course
oi the following pages, to discover something which may tend to prove
that the third lorrn ol the Antiphonary was an unfinished enterprise
whilst as yet the exemplar os the Corpus MS. was in course ot'
transcription or ol re-arrangement.

On comparing the antiphonarial indications which serve as sub-titles
to many of the masses in our Proprium de Tempore with the corre·
sponding offiniz in the Liturgicon ol Pamelius and in the authorized
Roman Gradual 1 lind that, whatever differences os constituent text
may in any instance be discoverable‚ the Antiphona assigned to a given
mass in any one os the three documents is invariably the Antiphona
assigned to it in the other two.

But this cannot be said oi the Proprium Sanctorum. For, whilst on
St Clement’s Day the Pamelian Antiphonary gives, as the first con·
stituent ol the rffcz'um, ‘Dicit Dominus Si quis testimonium meum,’ dte,
the Roman Gradual has ‘Dicit Dominus Sermones mei quos dedi,' δια,
our antiphonarial indication corresponding with the latter.

Now, 1 do not think that the liturgists anywhere declare St Gregory
to have compiled proper officia sor the whole series os saints’ masses,
and the fact Ι have just noted may serve us as a caution not to take it
lor granted that he did. There is no reason to believe that he achieved,
or indeed had undertaken‚ such an enterprise. On the contrary, when
the author ol the Micrologus tells us (cap. xtlll.) that he allowed one and
the same offidum to do duty for two distinct consessor pontifls, ii we
draw any inlerence at all on the subject, the only sale inserence must be
that, whatever Gregory may have hoped to accomplish‚ should leisure
be allowed him, he did not postpone the publication os his Antiphonary
