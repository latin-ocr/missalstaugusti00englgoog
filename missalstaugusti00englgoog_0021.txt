EGBERT, Archbishop os York between the years 732 and 766,
writing, in his ‘Institutio Catholica,' os the ember-seasons, tells us
(xvl. i.) that in the Church ol the English it was customary to observe
the primi mensis r'eiunium not as os necessity in the month ol March,
still less in the first week ol that month‚ but, invariably‚ in the week
beginning with the first Sunday ol Lent; and explains that the usage
had been authorized by St Gregory the Great:-‘ Nos autem in ecclesia
Anglorum idem primi mensis ieiunium (ut noster didascalus beatus
Gregorius in suo antiphonario et missali libro per paedagogum nostrum

beatum Augustinum transmisit ordinatum et rescriptum) indifferenter
de prima hebdomada quadragesimae seruamus¹.’

The obvious interpretation os the parenthetical clause in the sentence
just quoted has the support ol another passage (XVI. ii.) in the same
treatise, which gives us to understand that several copies both of the
antiphonary and os the missal sent by Gregory the Great to our island
were still extant at St Augustine’s Abbey-or, as it was then called,

the Abbey oi the Apostles Peter and Paul—outside the walls ol the
city ol Canterbury. Speaking os the r'eiunium quarti metuis he says,-
‘Hoc autem ieiunium idem beatus Gregorius per praelatum legatum in
antiphonario suo et missali in plena hebdomada post Pentecostem
Anglorum ecclesiae celebrandum destinauit. Quod non solum nostra
testantur antiphonaria, sed et ipsa quaecum missalibus suis conspeximus
apud apostolorum Petri et Pauli limina¹.'

Itis worthy ol remark (ι) that in these passages Egbert speaks, not
of Gregory's sacraruntarium or sacramentorum liber, but os his missale
or liber missalis; (2) that more copies than one were in existence at
St Augustine’s, Canterbury, in his time; and (3) that he seems to imply
