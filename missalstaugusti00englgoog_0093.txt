cedence ol the unqualified, and, as in the prayer before us ‘pia deuotio'
is balanced by ‘beata perennitas,' it is lair to conclude that, is Gregory
can have had a preference ior either form, it was ior the fuller. And the
luller form appears in, precisely, the recension which claims to exhibit his
maturet judgment and later touch.

The mass at iol. ις entitled ‘De sancta Maria’ serves as an appro-
priate stepping-stone to the next division ol the present subject.

Pamelius's anonymous editor gives us, substantially, the same mass
as this in the Gregorian hals os his book, and later on, in the prae·
Gregorian hals, a similar one; assigning the former to the Octave oi the
Nativity‚ and the latter to the first Sunday alter the feast. And Mura-
tori's anonymous editor does the like, except that he assigns each mass
y to the first Sunday aster Christmas.

But, both in Pamelius and Muratori, there isa very important differ·
ence between the Gregorian and the prae-Gregorian constitution os the
mass. The Gregorian mass has the same constituents as our ‘De sancta
Maria,' namely ‘Deus qui salutis,' ‘Muneribus nostris,’ and ‘Haec nos
communi0’; whilst the non-Gregorian consists oi ‘Deus qui salutis,’
‘Muneribus nostris,' and our Postcommunion sor the midnight mass lor
Christmas, ‘Da nobis q. d. d. noster!

The difference is no greater than that lound to exist between almost
any mass taken at haphazard in Menard and Da Rocca, on theone hand,
and the corresponding mass in Pamelius, D’Azevedo, Muratori, the Roman
Missal, and the Corpus MS, on the other. But the present interest oi
the difference lies in two iacts; first, that the one set oi constituents pro·
sesses to be of Gregorian, and the other oi prae-Gregorian assortment,
and, secondly, that they are found on examination to represent two
distinct recensione ol verbal text

Now, had St Gregory thought lit to accept and adhere to the con·
stituent text chosen by his predecessor, the ‘Deus qui salutis’ would
bave figured in the second, but not in the first, hali ol the anonymous
editor's sacramentary; or, had there been no prae-Gregorian attempt, it
would have figured solely in the first hals. But, as the case now stands,
the anonymous editor, wittingly or unwittingly, designedly or unde·
signedly, has sor once in the whole course os the year presented us with
a mass (1) under the constituent composition and in the verbal text given
to it by Gregory the Great, and (2) under the constituent composition and
in the verbal text ol some predecessor os Gregory’s

What, then, do we find when we examine the verbal textos either
