lin. 16, and at fol. 108 v, lin. 18; and (3) the Secreta ‘Accepta tibi sint
domine quaesumus nostra munera’ dac, at sol. 9, lin. 2. Let us examine
them each in its turn.

(1) In all the previously edited texts the subject ol the opening
clause ol the first ol these three prayers is not ‘oblata nostra,' but
‘nostra ieiunia’; and this is, certainly, the reading given by the Corpus
MS. at sol. 57, lin. 16. But the principal reviset of our volume, the
reviser whose handiwork is to be seen in the Canon, at iol. 47, and in one
or two other places, has set a note in the margin, directing the use ol
another prayer. For purposes of evidence, therefore, the ‘Ut accepta
tibi sint' as given in that particular place is put out ol court; and our
attention must be confined to our text os it at sol. 5511. Here, theu,
we note that the Corpus lorm ol the prayer is in contrast with that
exhibited by previous editions. They make the ember-sast, it makes
the proper oblation os bread and wine, the subject ol the opening clause.

l need scarcely observe that ‘oblata nostra’ has the same textual
measurement as ‘nostra ieiunia,’ but that the order ol the words is
inverted. Such a phrase as ‘munera nostra' or ‘nostra munera ’—as in
the prayer ‘Accepta tibi sint’-would be out ol place in the same
sentence with ‘munere sacramenti '3 and ‘nostra oblata' would oflend a
sensitive ear.

(2) As to the second Secreta, ‘Accepta sit in conspectu tuo
domine nostrae deuotionis oblatio’ dre, the evidence ol our book is
very remarkable.

' At iol. ov. the reviser has altered the transcriber's ‘qui uiuis' into
‘qui tecum uiuit’; at iol. 11 v. he has supplied an apparent omission3
at fol. 27o, lin. 5, he has erased a word, and ten lines lower down
transverted ‘reddat nos’ into ‘nos reddat' ; but Ι do not think that there
is any other instance os noticeable change, whether in the Proprium
de Tempore or the Proprium Sanctorum, except at sol. 87 v, lin. 2 and
at fol. 106, lin. 16. In these two places, however, we have one and the
same correction, that ol ‘nostra deuotio' into ‘nostrae deuotionis ob-
latio¹.' The reading, then, and the only reading, to which the monks of
St Augustine were accustomed—such, at least, is my conviction-was,
‘Accepta sit in conspectu tuo domine nostrae deuotionis oblatio’ And
yet, it is not the reading ol previous editions. They all say ‘Accepta
sit...nostra deuotio'; as though the proper subject ol a Secreta might
legitimately be held to consist os the Church’s abstract devotion, not
the concrete elements of bread and wine.

¹ These instances will recur in the next chapter.
