mous editor finds it written thus,-‘ Da nobis quaesumus Domine Deus
noster ut qui natiuitatem D. n. 1. C. uos frequentare gaudemus dignis
conuersationibus ad eius mereamur pertinere consortium Per Domi-
num,' word for word being identical with the ancient form preserved
in the Verona book (XL ἰ.). But, as has already been seen, when we
reach the date of what 1 have ventured to designate as Redaction B the
false ‘Per Dominum’ is superseded by ‘qui tecum’3 and when we reach
the later date of the revision represented by the Corpus MS. we find a
further improvement still in the substitution of ‘peruenire' for ‘pertinere'

Similarly with the Secreta In his prae-Gregorian mass the
anonymous editor reads it precisely as does the Verona book (xxm
iii.),-‘ Muneribus nostris, Domine, precibusque susceptis, et coelestibus
nos munda mysteriis et clementer exaudi! But, in his Gregorian mass
he finds it improved by an inserted ‘quaesumus' before ‘Domine’3 and,
when we come to the Corpus text, we note a still further development,
in the clause ‘per intercessionem beatae dei genitricis Mariae’

As to the Oratio, we read ‘tribue’ in Redaction Β. It is only on
turning to the Canterbury book that we find it replaced by ‘praesta';
and we may feel morally certain that, if the missing portion of the
Verona book should ever come to light, ‘tribue' will be found to have
been the prae-Gregorian reading.

Amongst such of the constituents of prae-Gregorian masses as
exhibit verbal contrasts between the Corpus MS. and the other books,
there is only one prayer to be found in the Verona fragment The
instance yielded by it is that numbered ΧΠ. in the list given at an
early part of the present chapter; but it does not claim a lengthy
mention. In the Corpus text ‘tibi' is govemed by ‘offerimus' in the
Verona book and in previous editions it is govemed by ‘sit'

There can be no doubt that at fol. 17 v, lin. 6, our ‘Munera d. oblata
sanctifica' is a preferable collocation to ‘Oblata d munera sanctifica,’
and it is that observed in all the primitive masses¹ of our volume, except
the third for Christmas Day, where the converse order is justified by
the inserted phrase ‘noua unigeniti tui natiuitate.’ But, of all the
primitive masses containing this Secreta there is only one, that of the
Sunday after the Octave of the Epiphany, which claims to be of
prae-Gregorian compilation, and it is in, precisely, that one mass that
our book exhibits the preferable collocation‚ whilst earlier editions all
read ‘Oblata d. munera’ &c The account 1 would hazard is, that
‘Oblata d munera’ was the ancient collocation‚ and that Gregory

¹ At fol. 1¹3 the prayer occurs in an adscititious mass under the form ⁴ Oblata d. munera’
