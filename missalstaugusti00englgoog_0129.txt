INTRODUCTION. cxlii

This resolution, line by line, with the exception ol but three letters at
the outset, of twenty lines ol our volume, beginning with the sixteenth
on lol. 9, into iorty short uncial lines, is so spontaneous as, really, ⁴to
call lor little remark. The seeming exceptions to this almost vital
spontaneity ol conversion are, indeed, ol the nature of confirmatory
prool. For:-

(1) lt was quite natural that the transcribet, on reaching the end of
Page vi. ol the exemplar, should make the ‘con' ol ‘consortium' begin
a new line in his copy. 1t was just the thing that he would uncon-
sciously do at the very momentus letting his attention pass lrorn the
foot of one page to the topos another3 and Ι will venture to say that,
but ior some such interruption, he would not have done it.

(2) 1r on reaching the seventh line oi Page vii. he had intended to
write out at length the whole ol the residue, including the super·
numerary UIS, he would have set it at the beginning, not the end, ol the
next line in his transcript. But he wrote it at the end oi the line,
dropping the ‘UIS,’ and thus lound himself with a short space to the
good between the ‘CONCEDE (ἵε οΠΡε* and the adjacent rubric. Hence
the misplaced D’S.

(3) The third line ol iol. 9²¹· of the transcript is insufficient to repre-
sent two complete lines of exemplar text; but the writer ol the ex-
emplar, having had to do with the assonant words ‘indignos' and ‘nos’
at the very moment when his attention was diverted by the detail of
leaving space lor the rubric ‘ALIA' may have written ‘Nos' three times
instead os twice.

Or, there may have been a hole in the vellum. The latter might
seem to be the most likely alternative, lor the very curious reason that
the thirteenth, like the third line ol sol. 9v. is sparsely filled3 but, on
the other hand, we must remember that at that very place there is an
inserted clause, ‘adueniente filio tuo domino nostro,’ and that the intro-
duction oi that clause may have occasioned some slight confusion or
irregularity in the exemplar.

(4) At iol. 9v, lin. 5, we come to that strange lapse of the tran-
scriber's which first put me in touch with the key to the stichometry of
the original. Why should he, or, perhaps, the clerk at whose dictation
he wrote, have conlounded forms so dissimilar in length as ‘qui tecum
uiuit' and ‘qui uiuis'? Or, why be puzzled at all il there was no
obliteration ol the text? Instead ol turning the leal and finding ‘UlT'
on the next page, he hastily scanned the thumb·worn parchment,
and, observing that alter QUI there certainly was room lor five letters
