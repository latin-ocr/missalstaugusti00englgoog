the Vigil 01 SS. Peter and Paul. On the contrary, it would seem to be
the unanimous opinion 01 the learned that the Leo whom the old
sacramentaries celebrate on the twenty-eighth 01 June was the great
Doctor 01 the Church, not his remote successor, and that the feast was
instituted by Sergius in memory os the translation 01 688¹. Thus in·
structed, we are not surprised to lind that in the Oratio 01 the mass
(iol. 97 v, lin. 10) the Corpus MS. differs not only from the other books
but from its own rendering 01 the same prayer at sol. 83, lin. 9. Our
solitary reading is ‘commemorationis eius festa recolimus'; the other is
‘commemorationis eius festa percolimus! But, surely, we are wrong
and the others are right; for, though ‘ percolere’ is by no means a usual
word, ‘sectari' being more likely, the proper sense 01 ‘recolere-pas-
ticularly when combined with such a phrase as ‘commemoratio eius'-
would seem to be ‘to keep over again,' as in an octave‘. Thus, in the
Verona book we have (xxl. xiv.) on the octave of St Laurence ‘festa
recolimus’ and, immediately afterwards, ‘solemnitas repitita'; whilst in
another place (vm. xxxi.) the word occurs in an Oratio which seems to
imply the same thing, and in the immediate sequel 01 a mass proper to
‘solemnia repetita! In our own book, too, we find on the Octave 01
St Laurence, and in a Gregorian mass (101. 111 v, lin. 20), ‘recolere
passionem‚’ and on that 01 St Andrew, again in aGregorian mass (101.

13611, lin. 11), ‘recolere patrocinia’ as the equivalent 01 ‘repetere
solennitatem''.

¹ 11 1 could feel sure that this is the exclusive meaning oi ‘recolere' in the Verona book, as it
‘seems to bein the Gregorian portions 01 our own, 1 should argue irorn the ‘Sanctae Caeciliae
iesta recolentes’ at xxxva iv. that St Caecilia’s Day had once bad an octave in Rome. But as
the Verona book is evidently the work 01 more pens than one it might be unsaie to adopt the view.
The Preiace ‘ln Pascha Annotina’ [Pam. 11. 568, Mur. 11. 315] gives us ¹ festa recolere!

³ 1 shall, 1 hope, be pardoned 101 devoting a t'ootnote to our Secreta ior St Lens-‘Annae
nobis d. q. ut intercessione beati Leonis confessoris tui nobis haec prosit oblatio quam immolando
totius mnndi tribuisti relaxari delicta! For this Parnelins has ‘Annae nobis d. ut interoessione
iamnli tui leonis haec nobis prosit' &c.; but he gives no authority 101 11, and 1 believe it to bea
clumsy composition 01 his own, or 01 somebody else who was seariul 01 giving scandal in au age
01 inevitably overstrung theological excitability. Its claim to authenticity is, 1 think, vitiated
by the phrase ‘intercessio famuli' 101 1 cannot find that ‘famulus’ is ever used oi the
beatiiied. Still, the ‘economy' was exercised openly enough, 101 Pamelius irankly states that
his manuscripts had some such prayer as this =-‘ Annne nobis d. ut animae famuli tui leonis
hace prosit' &c.; and the truth is that this and nothing else is the rading given by Menard and
Da Rocca, by D'Aaevedo and Muratoria not to mention the Jumieges book and the codex Rursus

1 believe that in the present case, as in very many others, the simplest explanation is the
right one. Let nssnppose (r) that between the years 684 and 688 the Secreta oi the mortuary
mass 101 Leo 11. had stood those-“Annae nobis dne (13 ut animae iamuli tui Leonis haec
prosit‘ 110, and (1) that on the translation in 688, the mortumy mass 101 Leo 11. being by this
