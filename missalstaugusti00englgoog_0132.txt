loss of that leaf cannot be too grievously deplored, for it has involved
the loss ol information not otherwise to be had conceming the con·
stituents of the mass3 and the relentless seraping of our present seventh
leaf, though it failed to obliterate the stain of the pigments employed for
the opening words of the Oratio and for the initials of Secreta and
Preface, did, unhappily, carry off both the rubric and the first letter ol
the Postcommunion. But, after calculating as best 1 can what must
have been the textual value of the Preface, and applying the severest
numerical tests at my command, Ι am convinced that the final con-
stituent was longer by a half than that extant in the reprints; whilst, as
to the Oratio, the existing condition of the vellum atiords an all too
cruel witness of our loss, for the prayer must have been almost as long
again as its presumable precursor. The words ‘Excita dn‘e q's‘ are
all that survives of it, but what followed itis impossible to guess. As
to the Postcommunion, the case is not quite so deplorable. For, assum-
ing, as we almost certainly may, that the erased Preface was that found
in menard and Da Rocca, in Pamelius and in Muratori, ‘Cui proprium
est et singulare‚' a composition containing 405 letters3 and, knowing, as
we do, that the Preface and Postcommunion together filled fifteen lines
and a half of the transcript, or about (1ςῇ x 38 =) 589 letters, we may
feel morally sure that the latter constituent was one of the four following,
‘Concede q. o. d. hanc gratiam,’ dre, ‘Praeveniat nos q. o. d. tua gratia
semper,' &c.‚ ‘ Praecinge q. d. d.,' dre, or ‘ Fac nos q. d. d.,' &0¹

The Secretae for the Second Sunday, for the Friday and Saturday in
the Emberweek, and for Christmas·Eve are peculiar to the Corpus MS. ;
whilst Christmas·Eve and the day-break of Christmas have Prefaces,
which, not having been cancelled by the owners of the book, must be
regarded and treated as authentis.

Another remarkable lact is the great length of some of the anti·
phonarial indications inserted after the titles of the several masses.
Beginning with that for the Second Sunday, which must have had
about 38 letters, Ι find that the aggregate number of letters in these
indications was about 177; though the usual average would have
yielded‚ l should say, 140. We may fairly say that they are 38 in excess
of the normal number. My reason for mentioning this detail will appear
presently.

Asin a later chapter Ι shall have to give some special attention to
our ember masses for the summer season, l will say no more about them
now. Excepting them, therefore, for the moment from more careful
