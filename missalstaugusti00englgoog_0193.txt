wheuever‚ in view os a new transcription, he introduced parenthetical
clauses or ablatives absolute, he strove to make them ol the value oi an
integral number of lines¹. Each oi these two courses would be strongly
urged upon him by the evils certain to result irom any considerable
disturbance ol the lineation of a book. There could be no stronger
inducement to accuracy of transcription than the knowledge that, except
at rarest intervals, the transcript was meant to correspond line by line
with the exemplar. And, indeed, the detection os errors would have
been extremely difficult but sor the observance of such a rule.

Il, then, we suppose St Gregory to have wished to cancel a word, or
to augment the' bulk oi a prayer by the insertion ol a syllable or tw0, it
would seem to stand to reason that he should endeavour to make good
the textual disturbance thus made at as early a moment as might be.
This is, precisely‚ what the Corpus MS. seems to prove him to have
done :-

We have seen that he added nearly a line os text to.the last prayer
sor the Wednesday after Reminiscere Sunday¹. lt was in the next
mass', and at a distance οἱ eleven lines, that, dropping the word
‘aetemae’ he made good half this loss of space, thus, no doubt, getting
his lines once more into proper train.

We have seen that on the following Wednesday⁴ he removed a
harmless but not necessary ‘nos' from the Secreta, when about in the
next prayer to transform ‘mensa caelestis' into ‘mensae caelestis
libatio! His text would seem to have stood thus :-

TESABOMNIBUSNOSDE·
FENDEPERICUL18·PER ·

Snwcrwrcurvosrcor‘r ·
NOSQUAPASTISUMUSMEN-
sncnuuassrsurncuuc-

l hope to shew on a later page how he effected the alteration.

We have seen that in the Secreta sor Sitientes Saturday he added
‘nostris' to ‘Oblationibus'; and we may without presumption say that
he would have acted worthily ol bis genius had he made this change
with the intention oi cancelling the redundant ‘nos' in the next prayerl.

in St Gregory’s day. The Thursday mass in the MS. must, therefore, be neglectetl.
