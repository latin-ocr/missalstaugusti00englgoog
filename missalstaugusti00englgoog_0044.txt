all in vain; because, as 1 apprehend, he confined his quest to the cemetery
os Praetextatus, in which he had good reason to believe that she had
been buried, but whence he was not aware that she had ever been
removed to a loculus on the other side os the Appian Way. Meanwhile,
t00, a rumour reached him that her body had been carried off by Aistuls
and his Lombards sixty years gone by; and he was already lending
credence to it when he dreamed a dream, or saw a vision, which
directed him to explore that part ol the Sixtine cemetery which lay
close to the papal crypt. There he sought, and there he secking found,
the body ol St Caecilia, lying on its right side in a coffin os cedar-wood.
The chamber in which it lay was close to the papal crypt, but proper
access to the shrine had been afforded by a distinct flight os steps
from above communicating with a doorway in the further end os

’ the chamber. A short passage had, however, at some early day been

cut between the two vaults; and there is good reason lor believing that
Paschal found it filled up, and carelully concealed by a sacing of ashlar
at either end¹.

Now, the question that most concerns us is, How long had the body
oi St Caecilia been hidden from view when Pope Paschal found it?
Paschal, who was a Roman by birth, had been educated at the Lateran
and had enjoyed the friendship ol Leo 111.; so that, ii St Caecilia's body
had down to so recent a date as the year 756 been year by year
venerated in a chamber closely adjoining that in which lay some os the
most illustrious ol his martyred predecessors, he surely was as likely as
any one to be cognizant oi the fact sixty years later.

As the event proved, the Lombards had not rifled her tomb ; aud 1
argue that isany os Paschal's clergy, or, indeed, any oi his laity,
had ever heard an authentic or presumably credible account, or picked
up an authentic or presumably credible serap os tradition, conceming
the site ol a tomb which, until it ceased to be frequented, had been
known as the centre ol an annual solemnity in which all Rome, from
the pontifi down to the humblest inhabitant, took part, the information
would, unquestionably, have been forthcoming ior Paschal's information
and guidance.

These considerations bridge over the latter hall ol the interval that
separated Paschal l. from Gregory the Great3 and 1 think we may rest

assured that St Caecilia's tomb had not been visited or visible as sar
ba'ck as the year γοα
