xlviii turnouucmou.

Apart, however, from the phrase ‘qui cum patre,' the Corpus MS.
has in this prayer a peculiarity which from its very slightness recom-
mends itsels to notice. All the rest have ‘in nostrae proficiant in·
firmitatis auxilium '; it alone‘has the masterly ‘ad’ in place os ‘ in.’

Although, then, it is only in two os these places that the Corpus MS.
stands alone when confronted with the Verona codex and with the rival
editions, yet the contrast between ‘in commemoratione' (=‘in festo’)
and ‘in commemorationem’ (=‘in memoriam '), between ‘proficere in
auxilium' and ‘proficere ad auxilium‚' between ‘per,’ &c and ‘qui cum
patre,' dte, is so striking as to confirm the inserence that, is ever there
existed a book containing an authoritative and final recension os St
Gregory’s verbal text, that book may have been the missal os a house
established by himself, but not in the first years of his pontificate.

The next instance, at sol. 63, lin. 14, does not call for special notice;
but it is typical of several which we are about to encounter in
the sequel, where the difference between the rival readings, though
slight, is lar from immaterial, ours being the preferable alternative.
The ‘sit tibi' ol previous editions is also the Verona collocation os the
two words.

Ι now corneto the last prayer os the last primitive mass os our
Proprium de Tempore, the Postcommunion at the beginning os sol. 71.
lt isos prae-Gregorian antiquity and is found in the Verona codex
(xl. vii), where it reads thus :—‘ Concede nobis d. q. ut sancta tua tibi
placito corde sumamus et quidquid in nostra mente uitiosum est ipsius
doni medicamine curetur. Per.’ Clearly‚ this ‘ut sancta tua tibi placito
corde sumamus' is out os place in a prayer designed‚ as the position
given to the prayer in the Verona book implies, lor use alter the act oi
communion. Menard and Da Rocca find ‘Concede nobis d. 'q. ut quic·
quid in nostra mente uitiosum est sacramenti quod sumpsimus medica·
tione curetur '-—a bold but effectual correction. Pamelius and Muratori
find a remedy proposed which corrects the theologica! difficulty whilst
doing the least possible violence to the text,—‘ Concede nobis d. qut
sacramenta quae sumpsimus quicquid in nostra mente uitiosum est
ipsius medicationis dono curetur,’ where ‘sacramenta’ is an accusative
absolute, ‘ipsa medicatio' being the equivalent ol ‘sacramenta’ That
the Corpus MS. improves on both os these there cannot be a question.
The plural inherited from the original ‘sancta tua' is converted into the
singular ‘sacramentum'; and the prayer becomes ‘Concede nobis d. q.

ut sacramentum quod sumpsimus quidquid in nostra mente uitiosum
est ipsius medicationis dono curetur? ,
