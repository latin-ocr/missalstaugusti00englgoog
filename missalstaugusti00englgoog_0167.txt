third, and in C1, readings less apposite in first and second, and a more
apposite in the third. And, since there are no converse instances in
qualification ol these facts, 1 think we have touched a clue which it may
be well to follow. Let us now turn to the remaining instances in

Clagstlerome in his letter ‘Ad Sunniam et Fretellam ' records no less

than nine instances of confusion between the enclitics σου and μου,
namely, two under Ps 5, v. 9, and one under each oi the following,
Ps. 7, v. 93 Ps. 16, v. 23 Ps. 17, v. 363 Ps. 21, v. 203 Ps. 22, v. 5; Ps. 58,
v.12; Ps. 118, v. 59¹. To these we may add 3 probable tenth, under
Ps. 118, v. 13, the Pamelian rendering os which is ‘In labiis meis
pronuntiaui omnia iudicia oris mei’ If it be true that the Roman
Psalter was a translation from κοινή, we may perhaps set down this
‘mei' sor ‘tui' as a clerical caprice, the ‘uoluntas’ of a ‘scriptor’ who
wished to identify the owner ol the lips with the owner os the mouth.
Be this as it may, there can be no doubt that there, as in so many
other instances in Class A, the right reading is that ol the second and
third editions ⁴

Our ‘benedicam Dominum' in passages from two'separate psalms,
where Pamelius in either case found ‘benedicam Domino,’ would seem
to shew that Gregory was aiming at uniformity in his use of the verb,
making it govem the accusative when employed as the equivalent os
‘laudare' unlike St Jerome, whose use, in the Vulgate at least, is in·
constant. Conversely, the pontifi, when using it as the analogue os
‘benefacere' as at fol. 60 (Ps. 27, v, 9), makes it take the dative.

The latinity ol the Pamelian ‘Attendite populus meus' is sar from
intolerable, and we may safely believe that St Gregory would not have
replaced it by ‘Attendite popule meus' had not the latter form been
more euphonious. It may, indeed, be that ‘populus meus’ was the
Roman, *popule meus' the Hieronymo-Roman iorm3 but it would per·
haps be sale to think that the nominative, as representing the λαός μου
os the Greek, was an instance oi pardonable xoaeognhlawhich Jerome
had been content to tolerate, and that St Gregory is to have the sole
creditos the change. And he seems, as in the instances just now
noticed, to have been consistent, lor at sol. 6211, as well as at iol. 67 v,
we find the nominative superseded by the vocative.

In A4, then, we have the derivative, of a bad Greek reading re-
placed by the derivative os a good one3 A6 and A8 give us incon·
