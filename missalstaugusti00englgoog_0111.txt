INTRODUCHON. xcix

indeed, such be needed-of the authenticity of that verbal text which
seems to be the peculiar property of the Corpus MS.

11. 1 now come to the second part of the present subject There
certainly are some unquestionably bad readings in the Proprium
Sanctorum of the Corpus MS. not exhibited by the corresponding places
in other editions. Do these bad readings occur, as in the Proprium de
Tempore, in adventitious masses only 3 or are they to be found, whether
exclusively or partially, in primary massesl

Besides these, there are a few readings peculiar to the Corpus MS,
which, if not absolutely reprehensible, are relatively inferior to their
competitors, and unworthy of the genius of St Gregory. Are the masses
in which they occur primary or adventitious?

There are also one or two bad or questionable readings which are
the joint property of the Corpus MS. and one or other of the better
known texts. ln which category of masses are they found?

At fol. 130, lin. 18, under title of an anniversary already proved by
external evidence to be post-Gregorian, and in a mass condemned to
deletion by the monks themselves of St Augustine's, we have, and
that in an Oratio, the questionable reading ‘confessionibus gloriosis' in
place of ⁶ confessione gloriosa’

And yet again. As if to complete the proof that our mass for St
Caecilia's Day had not formed partos the nucleus of the sacramentaries
at St Augustine’s, its Postcommunion is hopelessly corrupt. We do, in-
deed, lind the prayer written thus in a votive mass on fol. 143,-‘Haec
nos d. q. gratia semper exerceat ut diuinis instauret corda nostra mysteriis
et...intercessione laetificet ’3 but, bad as this may be, it is not so bad as
our version on sol. 133,-‘ Haec nos d. q. tua gratia semper exerceat et
diuinis instauret corda nostra mysteriis, et sanctae Ceciliae martyris
tuae commemoratione laetificet' lt is only when we turn to Menard,
Pamelius and the others, that we find the Latin language:-‘ Sic nos d.
gratia tua semper exerceat ut [or ‘ut et'] diuinis instaurct' &c

Analogous to this is our ‘dono' on St George’s Day (fol. 85 v, lin. 19).

Our prayer beginning at fol. 115 v, lin. 6, is found in the Verona
book (xxxvl. v.), with the sole exception that, for ‘sanctae Caeciliae,’ we
read ‘beatae Sabinae? But, surely, the final word should be, as in
Menard, D’Azevedo and Da Rocca, not ‘affectu' but ‘effectu’ We
have seen, however, in a previous chapter that the mass in honour of
St Sabina has no claim to rank with primitive work, and the prayer in
which the variant occurs is an Oratio.

A similar instance occurs at fol. 105 v, lin. 6, in the mass of SS.
