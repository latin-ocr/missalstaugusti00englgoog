The Verona book has two constituents for insertion infra activum,
-⁴ communicantes et diem sacratissimum pentecosten celebrantes quo
apostoli apostolorumque discipuli omnium charismatum spiritalia dona
sumpserunt' (xl. ii.) and ‘communicantes et diem Pentecosten sacratissi-
mum celebrantes quo Spiritus Sanctus apostolos plebemque credentium
praesentia suae maiestatis impleuit’ (x. i.); where it will be perceived '
that therecipients of the supematural favours of the Day of Pentecost
are not only the apostles but, besides them, the whole company of
believers. The difference is far from unimportant St Gregory in his
Homilies (11. xxvi. 3, xxx. 1, 4, 6, ιο) speaks of the disciples as recipients
of the baptism of lire, never of the apostles, still less of the apostles to
the exclusion of the rest And, curiously enough, the Lectionary in its

reading of Acts ii. 1 gives ‘omnes discipuli’ in place of the Vulgate
‘omnes' the unaccompanied ‘omnes’ representing the unaccompanied
πάντες of the Greek. Whether, therefore, 1 be right or wrong in think·
ing that it was the very antiquity ol the ‘communicantes' adopted by St
Gregory which must be held accountable for the survival of the inaccurate
‘apostolis' in his earlier redactions, that it is inaccurate—because inade-

quate—there cannot be a doubt ; that it does not express St Gregory's
view, as recorded in his Homilies, there cannot be a doubt; that it is out
os harmony with the plain text of the Lesson of the same mass there
cannot be a doubt We need not, therefore, hesitate to say that if
either of the two readings represent the later touch of St Gregory's pen
it is that which omits ‘apostolis’ Besides; unless ‘apostolis' in ‘apo-
stolis...apparuit’ be taken as a dutinus commodi, the statement lies under
the charge of a further inaccuracy, for the Apostles were no more the
sole witnesses than they were the sole recipients of the tongues of fire¹.

- l ventured just now to suggest that the occasional presence in the
editions published by Menard, Pamelius and others of what we should
noma-days consider the false conclusion ‘Per,' as appended to prayers
addressed to the Second Person of the Trinity, was a survival only to be
found in prayers of prae-Gregorian composition3 but 1 must be satisfied
with recording the opinion, for its discussion would carry me too far
afield. lt may, however, be that in the earlier years of his pontificato,
St Gregory, regarding the conclusion ‘Per' &c as an adjunct to the
prayer and not as a portion ol it, was content to use it in all cases, and
that he was the first to introduce the ‘qui uiuis3' which he did ata later

¹ D'Azevedo's ‘adueniens apostolis' is very interesting. It may be a conflate reading,
‘adueniens ’ having been suggested—by whom, who shall say i—asa substitute for the questioneble
‘apostolis’
