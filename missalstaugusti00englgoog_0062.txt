l INTRODUCTION.

Ῑ now turn to the instances of variation between the Corpus MS. and
the editions hitherto published, in respect of which the Verona book
does not supply us with a prae-Gregorian reading. Most, if not all, of
them will be found to be so manifestly analogous with one or other of
the typical instances just catalogued as to leave no moral doubt that the
reading in the editions hitherto published is either identical with that of
the now lost prae-Gregorian form, or else holds a middle place between
it and the Corpus reading.

The Postcommunion for the Second Sunday in Advent‚ in the re-
written work at the beginning of fol. 8, gives us the first of these :-
‘Repleti cibo spiritualis alimonie supplices te deprecamur omnipotens
deus’ &c The Roman reading is ‘Repleti...supplices te domine depre-
camur’ &c The changed place of ‘deprecamur’ is worthy of notice;
an alteration made, we may reasonably presume, at the same time with
the substitution of on'l'Psffs for DRE. Regarded whether in the light of
style or in that of theology, one form of the prayer is as good as the ·
other; but the curious difference between the two is that they are not of
the same textual measurement, the Canterbury on'lT’slis surpassing the
Roman DNE by the value of three letters. Now, on referring to the
fifth of our typical instances the reader will remember that the editor
of the Canterbury text seems to have allowed himself to duplicate the
word ‘nos' in the Postcommunion for the day before Passim-Sunday,
from no other motive than that of avoiding the disfigurement of spaced-
out writing or of its alternative, a blank erasure of the value of three
letters. Informed, therefore, by that instance and by others which will
come to view at the proper moment, I am inclined to think that our
on‘li’sffs in the place of DRE is referable to the mere technical necessity
of filling up a given space with a corresponding quantity of uniform and
consistent writing. Such necessity I believe to have been caused by
the substitution of the immediately preceding prayer, ‘Sacrificium tibi
domine’ &c., for one of almost but not precisely the same textual
measurement, ‘Placare quaesumus, domine’ &c 1 hope to revert to
this in my remarks on the Constituent Text.

In the Secreta for the Wednesday in the third week of Advent‚ at

fol. 9, lin. 2, we have one of a group of three prayers which, as presented
to us in the Corpus MS. illustrate each other very strikingly. These
three prayers are (1) the Secreta ‘Ut accepta tibi sint domine oblata
nostra' dcc, occurring at fol. 5511, lin. 13 and at fol. 57, lin. 16; (2) the

Secreta ‘Accepta sit in conspectu tuo domine nostrae deuotionis
oblatio’ dcc, occurring at fol. 75, lin. 12, at fol. 87 v, lin. 2, at fol. 106,
