(xvnl. xxv.) gives us the following: ‘Adesto quaesumus Domine plebi
tuae, ut quae sumpsere fideliter et mente sibi et oorpore te protegente
custodiat'; where ‘custodiat' is probably an error sor ‘custodiant' and
‘sibi’ sor ‘simul¹,' but where the singular ‘plebs' takes the plural ‘sump
sere! And there is another like it (xxxn. vi), ‘Munera quaesumus
Domine tuae plebis propitiatus assume, ut quae fidei pietate pmfrtentur

sacramentis coelestibus apprehendant' l think, therefore, that the
¹familia...abstinent...ieiunent' ol all other editions except the author·
ized Roman Missal is a genuine prae-Gregorian reading, and that our
‘familia...abstinet...ieiunet’ is an emendation ol it It, certainly, givesa
character os grammatical consistency to our book, lor at sol 24 v, lin. 2,
we have the same construction, ⁴samiha...abstinet...ieiunet,' as indeed
have all the other books.

At sol. 67, lin. 14, in the Secreta ‘Concede q. o. d. ut oculis tuae
maiestatis munus oblatum et gratiam nobis piae deuotionis obtineat et
eflectum beatae perennitatis adquirat: we stand alone with ‘piae de·
uotionis' as against the general ‘deuotionis’ On the other hand, at
lol. 33 rr, lin. 12 we are in accord with others in reading ‘deuotionis'
It is quite possible that both forms are prae-Gregorian; sor,whilst Ι find
but two instances os ‘deuotio' in the Verona book, I find as many as
ten os ‘pia deuotio ¹.' The lormer group includes an instance ol the
very phrase ‘deuotionis gratia'

Now, curicusly enough, St Gregory seems to have been more impartial
than his predecessors, and to have displayed his impartiality in his
original, as l believe him to have displayed it in his editorial, work. Ι
am sorry, however, not to have instances enough recorded to render this
as evident as l could wish. Still, there is a passage in the Moralia
(Vll. xxii.) where, alter saying ‘Quidam uero...piae confessionis sonitum
emittunt,' he subjoins ‘uocem confessionis resono! And, in like manner,
alter saying (1. xxxvi.) ‘si sein ipsa sanctae deuotionis uia caute cir-
cumspicere nesciunt' he subjoins ‘nisi magna se circumspectione custo-
diant...dum deuotionis portant hostiam in ipso itinere perdunt uitam!
But, as in each ol these instances the qualified substantive takes pre·
