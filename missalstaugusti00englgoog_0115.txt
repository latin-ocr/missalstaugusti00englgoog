thus raising the question whether the ‘intercessionibus' on fol. 88 be
resemble to the plural commemoration or be a proper variant¹. How·
ever this may be, the ‘adiuuemur' instead of ‘liberemur’ is inadmissible
when coupled, as on our Feast of SS. Alexander, Euentius and
Theodulus, with ‘a cunctis malis imminentibus! The word must have
been borrowed, one would suppose, by clerical error from the analogous
prayer ‘Da q. o d’ δια, which differs from this by the absence of the
words ‘a cunctis malis imminentibus’; or, if not horrowed, then retained
by clerical error after their introduction.

The question, then, for us to answer ls, Did the Roman Church in
St Gregory's day keep a festum in honour of SS. Alexander, Eventius
and Theodulus?

Bearing in mind that the Alexander of the third of May claims to
be a pope, letus examine the records.

The Martyrologium Hieronymianum mentions an Alexander under
date of v. Non. Mai, hut neither styles him hishop nor gives him a place
of honour :-‘ Romae uia Nomentana miliario vii natale sanctorum
luvenalis, Hebenti, Alexandri, Theodoli.' The Bucherian calendar and
the Verona codex know nothing of any sertum in honour whether of
Alexander or of Alexander and the other two; noris there any record
of them in the Monza papyri. That a visitor to Rome ln the seventh
century might have learnt where to find their tombs, there is no reason
whatever to doubt; but the manner of their mention in the Salzburg
and in the Malmesbury lists is not suggestive of the existence of a
festum in their honour. Nor is it easy to believe that, if the people of
Rome had been minded to take a double joumey of seven miles year
after year to the place where they lay interred‚ they would have fixed
the anniversary at so unfavourable a season as is the torrid May of
Central Italy. It seems probable, therefore, that the anniversary in
honour of the three saints was instituted in memory of their translation
to the Church of St Sabina by Pope Eugenius Il. (AD. 824-827),
an event commemorated by an inscription to be found in the Bol-
landists¹:-

‘Summa papatus Eugenius arce locatus
Corpus Alexandri praesulis egregii

Necnon Theodoli simul et te, martyr Euenti,
quta Sabinam Serapiamque piam

Aede sub hac posuit!
