cvl INTRODUCTION.

As early as the middle of the fifth century, and, possibly enough, at a
yet remoter date, there stood on the Salarian Way, and within seven
miles oi Rome, a basilica dedicated to the archangel Michael. At the
extreme close of the fifth, or in the early years os the sixth, century,
Pope Symmachus enlarged the building¹3 the middle of the seventh
century witnessed the mention ot' it found in the ‘De locis sanctis
martyrum ’-‘ ecclesiam sancti Michaelis vii. milliario ab Urbe”; and
in the pontificato of Leo 111. (ant 795-816) the ‘basilica beati Arch-
angeli quae ponitur in septimo' was still standing⁸.

Now, at some unascertained date between the pontificate os the
great Gregory and that ol Honorius 1, whose name has already been
mentioned in connexion with the church os St Valentine on the
Flaminian Way⁴-that is to say, between the years 606 and 624, for the
name ol the consecrating Pope was Bonisace-another church was
erected to St Michael. This new structure would seem from the very
day oi its consecration to have superseded and eclipsed the old one; the
mass which had been said year by year in the basilica in Salano six
miles from Rome being now said, not there, but in the basilica inter
nubes in or close to the city⁸. Nor was the sceneos St Michael’s annual
feast the only thing changed; the day forits celebration was shisted
from the thirtieth to the twenty-ninth oi September, and henceiorth
the title borne by the mass appropriated to it in the sacramentaries was
to be, not a direct devotional tribute to the glory oi the archangel, buta
record of the consecration oi a church that bore his name.

So effectually, indeed, was the old anniversary superseded by the
new, that, os all the sacramentaries and calendars 'on which the Bol-
landists have worked, there would seem to be none in which even a
record os its date (the thirtieth of September) was to be found, and only
one that presented even an indistinct record of the ancient basilica on
the Salarian Wayt-‘Corbeiense breuius,¹ says their editor, ‘ab omnibus
diuersum est Sic enim habet, Romae mt'llzarrb sarto dedabatio basilicae
angeli Michaelis ,· uel in monte qui dabitur Garganus⁸.’ Failing, however,
by a very strange oblivion, to identify the basilica thus hinted at in the
words ‘milliario sexto' with the church os St Michael, which, on the very

⁴ Three Popes ol the same name succeeded to the pontifioal throne during this interval,

second and the last being separated by Deusdedit.

the new basilica as the ‘De locis’ itsels does oi the old.
