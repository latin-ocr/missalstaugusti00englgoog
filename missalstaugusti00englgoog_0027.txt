would catch the eye of the celebrant when reciting the lllation‚ has
written in the margin the old proper Preface which St Gregory had, in
obedience to a venerable tradition, appropriated to the least

2. It is in the Presaces that we most vividly realize a possible
effect of the collocation in one document os constituents taken from
different sources. At fol. 41, lin. 3, and at sol. 46, lin. 4, the Easter
Prelace begins with the copulative conjunction-‘ Et te quidem’ &03
whilst at fol. 47, lin. 3, in an assignment which is almost certainly the
scribe’s, it opens with the customary ‘Te quidem! The difference is, in
itsell, slight enough; but, since the initial conjunction involves the
substitution of a longiora short lllation‚ l see in it an innovation,
indeed, but an innovation which no scribe would have been likely to
try to impose upon an ancient religious community; and am therefore
inclined to regard it as a change made by St Gregory himself.

3. This leads me to mention a peculiarity of the Corpus MS. which
inevitably arrests the attention ol those who inspect its pages sor the
first time. l refer to the erased Presaces. At a comparativcly early
date no lewer than fifty-eight ol the seventy Prelaces in the Proprium
de Tempore were, by means os a pencilled cross or obelus in the margin,
condemned to suppression3 and in the Proprium Sanctorum all, with
the scant exception ol three, received the same treatment. This con·

demnation was followed up in the former group by the erasure oi
fifty-five out ol the fifty-eight, in the latter by the erasure ol all the
condemned save ten. But we shall see in due time that twelve os these
thirteen survivals of the condemned are accidental, and the thirteenth is
an exception which proves the truth of my surmise as to the motive
for leaving the verbal text ol the' intruders uncorrected where it chanced
to be susceptible ol correction¹. All that it at present behoves me to

add is that the only Prelaces unstigmatized by the cross or obelus are
’ compositions in respect of which there is the very highest probability
that they survived by right of survival, and that that right had been
assured them by derivation from the original document.

² 1 refer to the preface in honour ol St Marcellus, which declares him not to hare been
amartyr [iol. 74v., lin. 6] in contradiction to the mass itsell‚ which emphatieally says that he
was. This, 1 repeat, is the only condemned Prelace in the Proprium Sanctorum which the
lrnile would seem ol set purpose and deliberately to bare sperem the presumable object being to
leave documentary prool that the series os compositions of which it wasa member were alien
amplificationi, in the case, at any rate, oi primitive massus. That thia particular mass was in
the original missrd is proved hya passage in the Micrologua which tells us (Cap. xuttl.) why it
was that Gregory gare St Marcellus, although a martyr, the officiam proper to a confessor.
