11. The readings common to the Pamelian text and our own as
against the Pio-Clementine are :-

111. Ι must now add a very remarkable instance, the only one of
its kind. The number oi readings contested is not two but three, one
to each oi the antiphonarios :-

61 30²² uteruas me ut eripias me

lV. ln noteworthy contrast to all but the first cleven oi the iore-
going instances are the following. Os each pair of rival readings one
is common to the Pamelian and Pio-Clementine books, the other is
proper to ourselves. How many oi them are in analogy with the first
eleven in Class A, and how many may fairly be ranked in another cate-
gory, are questions to which 1 must turn at an early moment Os the
first in the list 1 must, however, say at once that its right place is, not
improbabiy, in the supemumcrary group. Though the officium which
yields it is Gregorian, our copy oi it may have been taken irom some
alien book, ior the Fourth Sunday in Advent was a dominica uacans
with St Gregory.-
