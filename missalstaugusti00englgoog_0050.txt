circle of, precisely, those festa which were annually recurring events at
and near Rome at the time of St Augustine's mission than haphazard
reigns no longer. Then all is seen to be consistent and orderly with
the orderliness and the consistency of an operative and respected
law; then we perceive that we are dealing with masses which, as
regards, at least, their titulation—it is with this only that 1 am now
concerned-may well have been transferred with careful fidelity from
one or other of the Gregorian mass-books inspected by Archbishop
Egbert When feasts concur, the secondary mass has an ablativeease
title; but in all other cases, governed by ‘In fest0,' the title stands in
the genitive. This, l repeat, is a rule to which we lind no exception,
unless, indeed, l am mistaken in thinking that there is sufficient reason
for believing the ‘De sancta Caecilia' to be an adventitious mass. But
more of this anon.

So much for our general survey of the two Propria Ι now address
myself to the subject of the verbal text of the Corpus MS. Does it

One of them is represented in manuscripts made known by Da Rocca
and Menard, the other in those associated with the names of Pamelius
and Muratori. For reasons on which there is no need to dwell, the
second group has been accepted, and the first disallowed, by, l think,
universal consent. But, how so? Why, if the one constituent text
be genuine, must the other be spurious? For, surely, it is conceivable
that the compilation which liturgical scholars have refused may have
been an early selection of materials made by Gregory himself, and that
the only true reason in favour of our acceptance of the other compila-
tion is one hitherto unsuspected; the very obvious reason that it
represents not the sole, but the maturer, labours of the great pontifi.

However this may be, the action of Pope Pius V. was provoked, not
by any doubt as to the authenticity of the constituent textos the
