xx INTRODUCTION.

Between those lor Whitsunday and the Sunday alter the Octave the
Corpus missal exhibits two sets ol masses, first a lerial group (fol. 54-
rol. 55 v.) and then the triad ol the summer ember-season (lol 55 o.-
lol. 5 7). At the end ol the second, lourth and fifth ol the former series
the reviser has seta marginal note indicating these as the three several
places at which the ember·masses should severally have been inserted;
Gregory Vll, and alter him the Council of Clermont under the presi·
dency ol Urban 11, having ordained that the summer ember·last should
be observed during Whitsun·week and at no other time Now, since
the scribe had not set them forth in what was now their canonical place,
it is sair to conclude that he had set them forth as he lound them
collocated in No. 13 in a group by themselves, that is to say, but alter
the lerial masses ol Whitsunweelr and belore that lor the Sunday after
the Octave ol Pentecost; in such a place therelore as to leave it
uncertain whether they were to be said during or alter the octavo
This collocation tallias exactly with Archbishop Egbert's account¹ ol the
incidence ol St Gregory’s r'eiunium quarti mensis, and justifies us in
inserting, not only that our Proprium de Tempore isa coadunation ol
two or more documents, the elder, or oldest, ol which was rubricated
in conformity with the custom ol the age ol St Gregory the Great,
but, further, that such ancient MS. may have been one ol the
authentic missals which Archbishop Egbert tells us were in his time still
extant within the walls ol the Apostles Peter and Paul at Canterbury.
We inser that this may have been the case. l hope in the course ol
the following pages to raise the inlerence to the level ol moral certainty.

My object in the present chapter will be to ascertain whether such
ol the masses in the Proprium Sanctorum ol the Corpus MS. as are old
enough to date lrom the age ol Gregory the Great exhibit the sort ol
exterior characteristica, as distinguished from constituent and verbal

text, which we might hope to find in an accurate transcript ol an

authentic specimen ol a final or, at any rate, a matured revision ol the
pontill's liber sacramentorum

¹ There cun be no doubt ns to the scope ol Eghert's plena Mdonada ; lor in a neighbouring
passage (De Institutione Catholica xvi. iv) he says, speaking ol the latter days ol Advent, ‘lu
plena hebdomada consueuit, non solum quarta et sexta leria et sabbato, sed et iuges duodecim

diea’ His plena hebdomada post Pentecostar began on Whit·hlondny and ended nith the
Saturday ol the next weelo Migoe, Lxxxrx. 44² c. ·
