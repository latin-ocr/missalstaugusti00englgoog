Ol all the popes whom the Church oi Rome honoured with a festum
before the days oi Gregory the Great, there were precisely two os whom
it is certain that their bodies lay in the cemetery ol St Calixtus, and in
that particular vault in the cemetery ol St Calixtus which, contiguous to
the mbr'culum os St Caecilia, was, together with it, at some time until now,
I believe, undetermined, rendered inaccessible by reason os the obstruc-
tion ol the neighbouring galleries-Pope Fabian and Pope Sixtus 11,
the very pontiffs whose masses we have been discussing. 1 cannot find
any escape from the very obvious inierence, that St Gregory's reason lor
suppressing the separate celebration ol the respective festa oi the two
popes, and sor cancelling the mass os the virgin-martyr, was that the
time had come at which it was impossible to approach and venerate
their respective testing-places.

The question now occurs, When were the papal crypt and the cu·
baculum oi St Caecilia closed against approach? Or, il they were not
rendered inaccessible at one and the same time, when 'was the access
to either ol them barredl 1 ask this latter question because the Com·
mendatore de Rossi has very plausibly suggested¹ that a slight wall may
at one time have been run up across the short passage connectingthe
two chambers, and because, ii such was indeed the case, the account

The catalogue preserved at Monza ol the Roman martyrs before
whose' bodies lamps were bumed in or about, at any rate, the earlier
part ol the pontificate ol Gregory the Great makes no mention oi either
Pope Fabian or Pope Sixtus, but does include the name os St Caecilia3
and the labels appertaining to the vials in which the oils were sent by
St Gregory to Queen Theodelinda‚ though they mention St Caecilia,
yield no record of the other two¹. ln explanation oi this difference I
would venture to suggest that, when the olea were collected, the papal
crypt had been already rendered inaccessible by the earthing·up ol its
outcr approaches and the waning-up oi the passage connecting it with
the crcbr'culum oi St Caecilia3 but that this latter chamher was still
accessible from its outer entrance, though closed to approach from the
crypt os the popes. I mean, in other words, that at the time when
the oba were collected one-hali os that work os concealment had been
ὁ achieved‚ the final completion ol which was the motive cause ol the very
