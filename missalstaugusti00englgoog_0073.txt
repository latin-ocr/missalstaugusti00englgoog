lt may have been at the same sitting with the dropped ‘salutis' that
the writer ol the Corpus MS. committed the two textual blunders which
are to be found on iol. 27 v. At the fifteenth line he wrote ‘reddat nos';
but the principal reviser, whose work we know by the colour ol his ink
and his delicate firmness of touch, has been careful to correct the
reading to ‘nos reddat? And on the fifth line the reviset has with like
vigilance cancelled ‘nos’ in the phrase ‘ab omnibus nos deiende peri-
culis,' although the word is to be found in all previously printed copies
of the Gregorian mass for the Wednesday in the third week osAdvent1.
This caresul suppression is proos os the scrupulous pains taken by the
monks oi St Augustine’s to adhere to their own taetus classicus.
Regard being had to the respective mer-its oi the two readings, and to
the gist of the evidence, we shall be safe in thinking that the shorter
form is the later of the two.

Curiously enough—and the fact may serve to explain the pheno·
menon os two clerical errors in such close proximity-our book has on
sol. 27 v. no iewer than three readings proper to itself in the short space
oi five lines The first is that just noted, ‘defende' for ‘nos deiende!
The second is on the very next line, ‘Sanctificet nos d. qua pasti sumus
mensae caelestis libatio,' dic, where for ‘libatio' Gerbert in one oi his
MSS. finds ‘sancta libatio,’ but where Menard, Muratori, Pamelius,
D'Azevedo and Da Rocca ior ‘mensae caelestis libatio' give simply
‘mensa caelestis) The third shall be noticed presently.

The resemblance to the Corpus reading ol that given by Gerbert is
very curious. l strongly suspect that in this place the codcxgelasriznus
had (as we osten find in the Verona book) two alternative readings oi
equal textual measurement, the earlier being the bold and unusual
‘mensa caelestis: the later being ‘sancta libatio,' and that ‘mensae
caelestis sancta libatio’ is a mere amalgam of the two; but, that our
book exhibits a skiliul adaptation made by an authoritative editor, who,
satisfied with styling the banquet a heavenly one, had no mind to
burden ‘libatio’ with a characterizing adjective os slight cumulative
value But, whatever the motive of the change, and by whomsoever
made, the reading os the Corpus MS. is a reading peculiar to itsels3 and
1 venture to declare it the best oi the three. It certainly is supported

by the unburdened ‘uirtus’ of the prae-Gregorian ‘caelestis mensae
uirtus' occurring at fol. sort, line 7¹.

¹Our form, however, occurs in the ‘Missa pro Navigantibus' os Pamelius (ιι. 44²) and
Muratori (11. 199). See also Muratori 1. 107 for the soealled Gelasian reading.
