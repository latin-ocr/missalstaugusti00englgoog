missae’ and the ‘liber sacramentorum’ had not coalesced ;Ι whllst the

very title it bears—‘ Canon Missae '—seems to carry us back to that still
remoter age in which the canon of the mass was the only invariable part
of the sacred ceremony which had as yet been committed to writing, the
‘ordo missae' being as yet a thing of the future.

Though St Gregory's ‘liber sacramentorum' was the first book of
the name that came into general use in Rome, it was not the first that
had ever been put together. Nearly two centuries had already passed
since Voconius, a Mauritanian bishop, compiled, according to Gennadius,
a ‘sacramentorum egregium uolumen,' and since on the hither side of
the Mediterranean Musaeus, a presbyter of Marseilles, at the instance of
his bishop, Eustasius did the like—‘ composuit sacramentorum egregium
et non paruum uolumen ¹.' We may, therefore, fairly infer that the phrase
‘uolumen sacramentorum‚' in the sense of a volume of sacred formulae,
was as old as the age of Musaeus, and thus of Leo the Great.

Nor need we doubt that the phrase ‘liber missalis' was already in
'use when Gregory the Great became pope; for Agnellus in his ‘Liber
Pontificalis,' writes thus of Maximian who govemed the church of
Ravenna in the middle of the sixth century,-‘ Fecit omnes ecclesiasticos
libros...edidit namque missales [libros] per totum circulum anni et
sanctorum omnium; quotidianis namque et quadragesimalibus tem·
poribus vel quicquid ad ecclesiae ritum pertinet omnia ibi sine dubio
inuenietis? The context which follows this sentence is, certainly,
obscure; but, speaking as it does of a ‘grande uolumen mire exaratum,'
and of the ‘Romulides qui uiderunt duodecim libros sub uno uolu-
mine exaratos¹,' we are tempted to identify these twelve books in one
volume with the ‘missales [libri]' recorded in the immediate context,
and to infer that, like the so-called Leonian Sacramentary, Maximian's
liturgical compilation was arranged according to the months of the year.
But, however this may be, the phrase ‘missales libri’ seems to be half a
century older than Gregory ; and, when we 'remember that Gregorys
liturgical compilation was not a ‘uolumen duodecim librorum' buta
‘uolumen'unius libri,’ it seems'to follow that ‘missalis liber ' was a phrase
, ready to hand and waiting for his adoption so soon as the already exist·
ing ‘liber sacramentorum' should be made to, include within its covers
‘quicquid ad ecclesiae ritum pertinet'3 so soon, that is to say, as the
invariable and the variable portions of the sacred liturgy should be
united in one document.
