‘Miserere mei, Domine.' It would seem, then, that the prototype of the
Canterbury mass-books was compiled after the parent of the Pamelian
Antiphonary and before that of the Pio-Clementine.

There seem to have been no ‘libri sacramentorum' in Rome
before the days of St Gregory. The only liturgical document of
which we have information was the codex gelasianus ; but there is no
reason for believing that copies of it had ever been put in circulatim,
or even made. There is, indeed, no compelling reason to think of it as
other than a congeries of prayers extemporized from time to time by
successive popes, and of prefaces, some, at least, of which were the
product of the pen of Pope Gelasius. lt was, not improbably, an
uncopied record, accessible to such of the successors of Gelasius as
might care to borrow from its pages; but had been as little meant by
him to be turned to general use as in a later age and another country
was Domesday·book by William the Conqueror. On the other hand,
there cannot be a doubt that the canon was a formulated document in
constant and general use long before the age of Gregory the Great' It
was, in his belief, of immemorial antiquity; and a full half century
before him Pope Vigilius had written of it as a formula handed down to
the Roman Church ‘ex apostolica traditione¹.’

So long, then, as the use of certain fixed prayers on the several
Sundays, festa and solemnized fenice of the year had not, whether by
express enactment or by custom possessing the force of law, become
obligatory to the exclusion of all other prayers, and obligatory on all
who used the canon of the mass so long must we suppose the canon of
the mass to have remained a separate document. And, indeed, it only
stands to reason that, so long as St Gregory's ‘liber sacramentorum’
was an inchoate and tentative enterprise, so long must the pontiff have
abstained, if only out of reverence, from binding up the canon of the
mass in one and the same volume with it

Here, then, two questions arise, Did St Gregory at any period of his
pontificate thus combine the ‘canon missae’ and the ‘liber sacramen·

torum’? and, If he did, what name did he assign to the complex
volume ἓ
