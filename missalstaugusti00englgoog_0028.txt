long a¹ tale os alien Prefaces into the missal before us. But lor that
offence, the volume would not have been enriched, as now we find it, by
salvage from no less precious a collection than St Augustine's anti·
phonary, the 'companion ol his mass-book. And 1 am bold to add that,
but lor that offence, the volume would long ere this have perished, and,
. with it, all memory, all trace, all hint ol the liber missam which the
great Gregory's lorty missionaries brought with them when thirteen
centuries ago they set foot on our shore-all memory, all trace, all hint,
save the meagre account given us by Archbishop Egbert How sar the
Corpus MS. corresponds with that account we shall see in due time.

Tus Ruurncs or rurs Prummu on Tempora

Il, indeed, the Corpus MS. be, what 1 believe it to be, a complex
document comprising, with some slight but inevitable modifications, the
several contents of the very liber missalis which Augustine brought to
Canterbury, and, intermingled with these, such accumulations as in the
course ol five centuries accrued to the original store, it must be of the
first importance to know which ol the several masses contained in the
Proprium de Tempore correspond to Sundays and other anniversarios
recognized by Gregory in his great editorial undertaking.

of the masses contained in the first sixty-five leaves (sol. 7—lol. 7121.)
there are some which cannot have had a place in any such book as
St Augustine’s liber massalis :—

1. Liturgiologists are, 1 believe, unanimously os opinion that St
Gregory knew nothing os any such mass as that, at iol. 14 v, in honour
oi the Circumcision. The author oi the ‘Micrologus' says (Cap. xxxmo),
-‘ In octaua Domini iuxta Romanam auctoritatem non officium “Puer
natus est '' sed “Vultum tuum” cantamus; et orationem gregorianam
“Deus qui salutis aeternae,” non illam “Deus qui nos'' dicimus¹.' The
mass, that is to say, ol his preference was that which in our book is
entitled ‘De Sancta Maria? It occurs at sol. 153 where, curiously
enough, it not only follows the compilation entitled ‘In die circumcisionis
Domini’ but also takes precedence ol that lor the First Sunday alter
Christmas-a double misplacement ol some significance.

2. The mass just mentioned, ‘Dominica prima post natale Domini,'
cannot, 1 think, establish a claim to rank as Gregorian.
