know to have been brought to England by St Augustine and his fellow
missionaries.

Of those who, under the name of Valentine, claim the honours of the
altar on the fourteenth day of February the most conspicuous are Valen-
tine, a priest who suffered at Rome, and Valentine of Interamna, a
bishop. Assuming the genuineness of the Acta of the Roman saint so
far as to believe that he was beheaded on the Flaminian Way in the
year 269, and on the fourteenth of February, we yet perforce pause in
doubt as to the date of the institution of his festum when we learn that
the following sentence occurs in only one of the MSS. on which the
Bollandists base their text-‘lbi postea a Iulio papa fabricata est
ecclesia in honorem sancti Valentini presbyteri et martyris, et mirifice
decorata, inqua deuote petentibus beneficia Domini praestantur usque
in hodiernum diem ¹.' But this is by no means our only difficulty :—

The Liberian Catalogue, which ends with the pontificate of Liberius,
says of his immediate predecessor, Julius,-‘ Hic multas fabricas fecit:
basilicam in uia Portuensi milliario iii, basilicam in uia Flaminia millia·
rio ii, quae appellatur Valentini, basilicam Iuliam, quae est regione vii,
iuxta forum diui Traiani, basilicam trans Tiberim regione xiv, iuxta
Callistum, basilicam in uia Aurelia milliario iii ad Callistum¹'; where it
is worthy of note that, if the basilica Jult'a was so called after the pope in
whose pontificate it was erected, the basilica Valentini may have received
its name from a living man, not a dead one. We cannot, indeed, with
certainty conclude from the absence of such words as ‘beati' ‘sancti'
and ‘martyris' that this must have been the case, for the Liberian Cata-
logue bas no other recorda of the kind on which to base an argument
from analogy. But the record of Pope Julius preserved in the Liber
Pontificalis (ξ 50) lends probability to the view, lor that document in its
mention of the building on the Flaminian Way withholds even the name
of Valentine—‘ Fecit duas basilicas in urbe Romana, unam iuxta forum

' et aliam uia Flaminia '-a style oi relation strikingly nnlike that used by

the contributors to the Liber Pontificalis when writing of churches dedi-
cated to the memory of martyred saints’.

⁸ The Bucherian Kalendas, so called after the learned Jeauit who drew attention to it, must
not be leti without mention in this connexion; for, singularly enough, it is a fourth-century
document dedicated to a certain Valentinus Bucber himself was the tirst to suggest that the
Valentine ol the basilica and the Valentine of the kalendar may have been one and the nme
person ;-‘ Valentino cuidam inscribitur, mihi hactenus ignoto; nisi quod paullo ante basilicam
a Jnlio pontifioe in uia Flaminia milliario secundo constructam Valentini appellatam notem An
idem sit cogitandum relinquo! The document as described hythe Bollandists [Vol. 7 lor June]
