Roman Missal then in use, a constituent text similar to the Pamelian,
but by the imperative duty of amending the verbal text; for that
appeared to have undergone a deterioration which called for instant
remedy¹. In truth, however, the defect under which it laboured was an
original evil. There would seem to have been no deterioration—at any
rate, no grave deterioration—from its first estate; and its fault was the
mere outcome of an incomplete and unperfected recension at the hands
, of Gregory himself. What happened to his homilies seems to have
happened to his liber sacramentorum. Copies of it would seem to have
been made in 3ηά about Rome when he had, as yet, found time to

purge but one class of its constituents from errors as old as the codex
gelasianus itself3 and, being made, were multiplied in such profusion
as to imperil and frustrate the ultimate survival of a final recension,
should such recension ever see the day. That it did see the day Ι
now fully believe; and the most plausible account 1 can suggest of
its history in Rome is, that it was crowded out by its predecessors.

Political troubles may have had much to do with the catastrophe;
but no particulars have been preserved to us from which to deduce
a theory that shall account for it. ’

We know not for how long or for how short 3 time it may have
struggled for existence under the very shadow of the Lateran. Nor
need we care to know. For, carried by Augustine and his monks to
the shores of a remote and dim-discovered island, it survived, by we
know not what providences, the perils of ten centuries and the oblivion
of three, awaiting there the happy moment of its resurrection to the day.

Such, then, is the higher claim which Ι advance for our copy of the
Missal of St Augustine’s Abbey at Canterbury. 1 believe, that is to
say, that it exhibits to us a late and hitherto unsuspected recension by
St Gregory himself of the verbal text of the Gregorian Sacramentary.

The task Ι now assign myself is easy enough of statement; it is that
of examining the several instances in which the verbal text ol our
volume differs from that of the editions hitherto printed, or, at any
rate, from that of so many of them as on such 3ηά such occasions
agree with it in presenting to us such and such an Oratio, Secreta,
Postcommunion, or other constituent. Ι shall deal, first, with those
that occur in masses of Gregorian compilation; then, with those that
occur in masses which would seem to have been compiled before the
time of Gregory the Great, but reeditcd by him; and, lastly, with those
found in masses of post-Gregorian compilation.
