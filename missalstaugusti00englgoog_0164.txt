the last lew years , os the twenty-seven-to say the very least-the
annual cry oi the Roman Church in the Introit sor the feast oi SS.
Fabian and Sebastian had been, ‘Intret in conspectu tuo gemitus com·
peditorum„ redde uicinis nostris septuplum in sinu eorum, uindica
sanguinem seruorum tuorum qui effusus est.’ But, now that the sear and
the incidence oi the siege had robbed the feast of hali its splendours, and
enveloped one oi the two shrines with darkness, what more natural, what
more devout, a thought than, by the pious substitution os ‘sanctorum' ior
‘seruorum' to pray Heaven to avenge, now no longer the sufferings os a
siniul people, but the blood os Its insulted saints—‘uindico sanguinem
sanctorum tuorum ’-and ior their sake epare the city?

And, indeed, 1 am bold enough to think that the previous and long·
protracted occupation os central Italy by the Lombards-‘ uiginti iamet
septem annos ducimus quod in hac urbe inter Langobardorum gladios
uiuimus ’-gave to the Antiphonary oi St Gregory, or rather one portion
oi it, a characteristic which, so sar as 1 am aware, has not hitherto been
noticed, still less elucidated. 1 mean the characteristic oi suppliant
petition ior deliverance from an ever present trouble It confronts us
evermore in, at least, the post-pentecostal series. 1 do not say that
every single constituent os the several officia is a cry ior deliverance, but
1 do say that most os the iffae betray a consciousness os imminent
trouble which, in whatsoever degree relieved by hope, is so persistently
present as almost to compel the inierence that they were compiled under
the shadow os some imminent calamity. Turn to the Homilies, end we
find :-‘ Quid est iam, rogo, quod in hoc mundo libeat? Ubique luctus
aspicimus, ubique gemitus audimus Destructae urbes, euersa sunt
castra, depopulati agri, in solitudinem terra redacta est Nullus in agris
incola, pene nullus in urbibus inhabitator remansit...alios in captiui·
tatem duci, alios detruncari, alios interfici uidemus Quid est ergo quod
in hac uita libeat, fratres mei l...Ubi enim senatus? Ubi iam populus i...
Et tamen ipsos nos paucos qui remansimus adhuc quotidie gladii, adhuc
quotidie innumerae tribulationes premunt...Iam uacua ardet Roma
Quid autem ista de hominibus dicimus, cum, ruinis crebrescentibus, ipsa
quoque destrui aedificia uidemus i...postquam deiecerunt homines etiam
parietes cadunt¹.' Turn to the Antiphonary, and these are the passages

oi his selection :-‘ Saluum me iac ab omnibus persequentibus me‚’ ‘eripe
animam meam,’ ‘saluum me sac propter misericordiam tuam,' ‘respice in
me et miserere mei,’ ‘uide humilitatem meam,’ ‘exaudiuit uocem meam
