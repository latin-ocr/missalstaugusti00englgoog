l think that all who carefully read our ‘Oramus et pro paganis'
&c will be of opinion that the ‘dominum nostrum' at its conclusion
(fol. 39, lin 14) is unquestionably preferable to the ‘deum et dominum
&c' of the present Roman Missal or the ‘deum et dominum nostrum’ of
the reprints, a form suggested, in all probability, by the frequently
recurring ‘deus et dominus noster’ of these Good·Friday invitations

1 must now quote a well-known portion of the ordinary of the Mass
as celebrated on Bastar-Eue in accordance with Menard’s text

77. Dominus uobiscum.

g. Et cum spiritu tuo.

. Sursum corda
fe Habemus ad Dominum.
7). Gratias agamus Domino Deo nostro.
R. Dignum et iustum est'

The celebrant then continues in Menard :-‘ Vere dignum et iustum
est aequum et salutare nos tibi semper et ubique gratias agere, Domine
sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus. Te omni quidem tempore sed
in hac potissimum nocte collaudare et praedicare, per Christum Dominum
nostrum, qui inferorum claustra disrumpens uictoriae suae clara uexilla
suscepit, et triumphato diabolo uictor a mortuis resurrexit Et ideo' &a
On the day itself Menard has another and better known Preface, which,

though we gram them not to bave been originally part of the text, figure more satisfactorily as
additions than as substitutes. Thus (x.):-‘ Sacri nos Domine muneris operatio mundet et
foueat renonet et donis societ sempitemis’; where ‘renouet’ may. as the brothers Ballerini
declara, be a various reading for ‘foueat' hut where one would much rather believe that it is
either alost word restored or a felicitans addition to the phrase. Agsin, it may be that in the
following Preface (vm. xxix.) one or other of the two transitive verbs is superfluous; but them
iano reason why one should not have as much right there as the other, or, being there, should
not remeius-‘Quoniam tu es gloriosus in sanctis, quibus et in persecutione tolerantiam tri·
buisti et in passione uictoriam contulisti! Again, the Preface ‘Qui secundum promissionis
tuae,' dte.. occurs twice lxv, i., xvt. xia). in une place with ‘ab electorum tuorum principali
traditione non dissonant‚' in the other with ‘ab electorum tuorum traditione non dissonant’;
but who shall say which uf the two forms is the earlier? And yet agaim which of the two
following shall we pmnounce the earlier, which the better (xvi. xiii.. xvi. xi). ‘Nos eninr
temporalibus flagellas incommodia' or ‘Nos ideo temporalibus salubriter flagellas incommodis'?
Shall we say that in each instance ‘temporalibus' was meant to replace ‘salubriter,' and that
the adverb now keeps its place in one of them by mere clerical error? Or shall we say that
the fuller form is the true one, and that the adverb has been accidentally dropped iu one of the
two passages? Or, that eachisright?

When, then, Ι just now suggested that St Gregory may have desired that the words ‘et
ipsi’ should figure before ‘digni‘ in his ‘Oramus pro catechumenis,'1 did not mean to imply
that he may not bave found them waiting for him in the codex gelasrbrrus. And he may have
found them there either as a suggested altemative for ‘digni’ or as candidates for the place they
now hold in the text.
