Thus, in one place (lx. xvi.) he contrasts ‘famulantes interius' with
’ ‘quasi aduersantcs exterius,' and in another (vl. xviii.) ‘deuote famulari’
with ‘nolens seruire'; whilst in a third (xxxl. vii.) he speaks oi kings
who ‘ Deo deuotione famulantur!

Furthermore, and as indicating a distinctiones another sort, there are
passages which prove that, whether the objectos the homage be good or
bad, Gregory’s choice ol the verb for expressing it is guided by the
spontaneity or the unwillingness which characterize those who pay it.
Thus, he says oi the soul that is thought to be serving God but is
serving devils (V. xxxi), ‘ ut...quo remota ab externis actionibus seruire
*Dec creditur, eo magis eorum tyrannidi illicita cogitando famuletur'3
and there is a passage (v. xlv.) in which, with an admirable subjec-
tivity oi logical analysis, he uses ‘famulari’ oi anger so long as itowns
the control ol reason, and ‘seruire’ ol the same emotion when it disdains
todo so :—‘ tunc enim robustius contra uitia erigitur cum subdita rationi
famulatur; nam si immoderata mentem uicerit rationi protinus seruire
contemnit¹.’

1 conclude, therefore, that il either ol the two claimants to a place in
the last prayer os the mass lor the Wednesday alter the Third Sunday
in Lent, and ol that lor the Friday alter Passion Sunday', be reierable
to the correcting pen oi St Gregory, it is ‘famulemur,' not ‘seruiamus⁸';

because the idea implied by it is that of service, not slavery; because
the object oi that service is supremely good, and because the service
itsell is willingly paid. ,

A careiul study ol the Lenten benedictory prayers styled Super
populum will, 1 think, convince the reader that the ‘protectione' at iol.
3011, lin. 12, oi the Corpus MS. is required by the context, and that it
has intentionally been made to take the place os ‘ pietate⁴.' ’

¹ See, too, a like instance at xl. ir. (hligne, cxxv. 95613), where ‘tammari auctori omnium’
is used cs the intellectual homage os the wichad who deny tu ch the homage oi the beart.
Gregory seems oi set purpose to have chosen ‘famulari’ thus the better to illustrate the pro·
position he had just enunciated‚ that ‘concorditer sentiunt quamuis non concorditer uiuant? lt
ls thia spontanelty oi intellectual assent which makes ‘famulari' not ‘seruire' the proper word.

¹'l’he &cau lor this Mass (iol. 3av., lin. sc) has ‘tuis seruire sinubus) a phrase which,
by its cennas to the ‘ tibi lamularl' os the Super populum, serves harther to illustrate the sort
oi distinction which St Gregory seeum to have made. The Verona book has, indifferently, both
‘seruire altaribus’ and ‘famulari altaribus?

⁸ See Eadmer, ‘Historia Novomm,’ Rolls edition, p. 26, u. a. ior an instance oi ‘seruire’
replaced by ‘undae‘

⁴ lt is true that both ‘pietas’ and ‘protectio’ occur in the penultimate prayer on sol. 26, but
‘prorectio’is the object aimed at. At the middle oi iol. ²4 v. see the ‘pietas’ os the protasis
and the ‘misericordiae effectus' nithe apodosis. See, too, ff. 26 (3). sy (7), ny (17), η v. (rc),
