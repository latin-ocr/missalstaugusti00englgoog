hope was that the only tenable theory would in due course os time
reveal itsels.

The evidence yielded by the rubrics os the second Proprium¹ pre-
ceded in order os time the deductions suggested by those oi the first¹.
My attention had been drawn to them by the capitulum ‘De sancta
Cecilia' on lol. 132 v, and seriously engaged by the considerations it
suggested⁸.

N ext ln order of time came the discovery ol the textual capacity of
a page os the exemplar os the Missal⁴. As 1 had a lew years previously
learnt lrom another Corpus MS. how happy might be the results ol such
a discoveryl, 1 could but hope that, in some as yet unsuspected way, the
fact now ascertained might open out to me the history of the document.

Next came the very reassuring witness to the antiquity of the proto·
type which Ι discerned in the Mass ‘In Veneratione sancti Michaelis
archangeli' on sol. 122⁶. As yet, however-I am now referring to a
brief interval os work in an otherwise idle year, the year 189o—I had
not the remotest thought that prototype and exemplar could have been
one and the same book ; and, indeed, had the idea occurred to me, Ι
should not as yet have felt justified in giving serious heed to it

Reverting to my collation ol the two Propria, 1 next endeavoured to
form a just estimate ol the peculiarities os the verbal text os the Corpus

MS. To this subject no lewer than sixty-six pages ol the Introduction ’

have been devoted⁷3 but the trouble was well bestowed. It issued in
the certain conviction that the Corpus MS. embodied, as regards those
ol its Masses which must have come under the editorial cognizance ol
St Gregory, an authentic recension the very existence ol which would
seem never as yet to have been suspected.

Reassured by the discovery oi what now claims to be the pum
putus tactus ol the Gregorian Sacramentary, Ι next turned my attention
to those Masses in the Corpus MS. which prove the Missal ol St Augus·
tine's to have embodied, as regards its constituent, no less than its
verbal, text, the results ol a comparatively late revision. The outcome
