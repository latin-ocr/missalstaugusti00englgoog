xciv INTRODUCTION.

to the Corpus MS, and, (Ι) selecting such of the masses indicated as
have either an absolute or a highly probable claim to be regarded as
primitive, shall enquire if the instances they yield be in analogy with
those which we have culled from primitive masses in the Proprium de
Tempore. That done, Ι shall (ΙΙ) segregate from the readings which
remain such as are, or seem to be, inferior to their several rivals in
previous editions, and enquire if the verbal text of the masses which
contain them have on historical grounds any probable claim to be
regarded as primitive. Most, if not all, of the residue-the greater
part of them not true variants, but inserted clauses-will, ou examination,
be found to be irrelevant to the present enquiry.

1. The mass, beginning at fol. 74, lin. 17, in honour of St Marcellus
may fairly claim to be primitive ; for the author of the Micrologus (cap.
XL111.) tells us what was the Antiphona, or Introit, which Gregory
assigned to it, and what his reason for the attribution. Now, the Verona*
form (xxl. vii.) of the Secreta is ‘Accipe q. d. munera dignanter oblata
et beati Laurentii suffragantibus meritis ad nostrae salutis auxilium
. prouenire concede’; and thus it appears, mutatis mutandis, at fol. 11v,
lin. 20, of our volume. In the mass for St Marcellus, however, the
other texts replace ‘Accipe’ by ‘Suscipe¹,' and the Corpus MS. makes
the further change of replacing ‘auxilium' by ‘remedium’; the single
and the double improvement being thus in proper chronological order.
And, as if to complete the analogy with some of the most interesting
instances in the preceding chapter, St Gregory has himself shewn us in
his Preface to the Moralia‘ that the Corpus reading ‘salutis remedium'
is a phrase of his own :-‘ Haereticorum sacrificia accepta Deo esse
nequeunt nisi pro eis uniuersalis ecclesiae manibus offerantur, ut eius
meritis remedium salutis inueniant quam uerborum iaculis impugnando
feriebant.’

St Sebastian must have been in receipt of liturgical honours in the
time of Gregory the Great, for one of the pontifis homilies (the thirty-
seventh on the Gospels) was preached on his feast and in his basilica
Our ‘nostrae deuotionis oblati0,' therefore, which has a precedent at
fol. 9, lin. 3, may thus assert a claim to be regarded as the outcome of
what l venture to name as Redaction D.

The Nativity of the Baptist had, in prae-Gregorian times, been
preceded by a vigil; we must therefore regard as primitive the mass

the previous chapter).
