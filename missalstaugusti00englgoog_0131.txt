exemplar 01 the Corpus MS. wasa volume 01 unicolumnar pages ; that
each page held twenty lines; and that each line had the average con·
tent 01 about nineteen letters. That the rulings were not 311 01
absolutely the same width, is more than possible; 1011 find that Pages
v. and vi. had 370 and 363 letters respectively, independent 01 capitals
outside the ruling; that vii. and viii. had 373 and 390 respectively;
and that ix. and x. had 368 and 382.

Page xi. 01 1110 exemplar began with the fifth letter 01 ‘natiuitatis'

to the end of the second Christmas mass, but omitting marginated
capitals, and resolving all contractions with the exception 01 011113 and
01 D‘N'S,158, 1110 and ch and their cases,I find that the total number
01 letters is 2283 (=6 x 3803)¹, 3 number sufficient to fill 3 hundred and
twenty lines 01 1110 average content 01 19 letters and an infinitesimally
small fraction. This goes to prove that in the exemplar 01 1110 Corpus

volume.

As to the question, then, with which 1 opened the present chapter,
thus much, at least, is evident; that the exemplar 01 1110 Corpus MS.
may have been the very book—or, rather, one 01 1110 two or more books
-which St Augustine brought to England. lt, manilestly, was a book
