book¹ in search of other such peculiarities as have already been en-
countered, pass on into the Proprium Sanctorum.

At fol. 75, lin. 12 there are traces of an erased ‘tibi' between the
first and second words of the well-known ‘Accepta sit in conspectu tuo?
Ι turn to the title of the mass in quest of a clue, and what do 1 find?
l find that this is the composite mass in honour of SS. Fabian and
Sebastian', the three constituents of which were selections from three

⁴ pairs of rival candidates; and l note with more pleasure than surprise
that, of the two competitors for the place of Secreta, the discarded
prayer had forits second word ‘ tibi '—‘Hostias tibi domine,' &c Again
Ι ask, Can this be chance? Here, as once in the ferial mass for the
Wednesday in Whitsunweek, and as twice in the ember mass of the
following Saturday‚ there were two prayers in the exemplar3 and, in
one of the fits of absence which were so peculiarly his own, the scribe
all unthinkingly passed from one prayer to the other. l cannot persuade
myself that any book but the derivative of a working copy could over
and over again present us with phenomena such as these.

Here, however, let me pause to remark, that, saie though it be for us,
whose task is analytical, to record St Gregory’s work in terms of letters,
there is no reason to think that he would observe a method so minute
and laborious. A practised eye readily informed him how many lines
would accommodate a given prayer, with or without its rubric, with or
without its conclusion ; and what economy of penmanship would, in the
case of this prayer or of that, be needed in order to set the rubric of the
next prayer at or near to the end of a line.

Again‚ then, l turn the leaves of the volume; and, confining my
attention to Roman festa old enough to have been kept by St Gregory,
find nothing to invite notice until Ι corne to fol. 109 v, where in the
outer margin is a memorandum suggesting the use of another Secreta
than that given in the text, a memorandum, that is to say, analogous to
the two on fol. 57. Will it be believed? The mass itself has been
analogously treated with the last of the new set of summer ember
masses which Gregory had destined for incorporation into Subredaction

¹ But, although I abstain from saying over again what has so recenrty been said about
St Gregory's reconstruction of the Whitsun·week masses, 1 must not therefore neglect to notice
the conclusion of the Oratio of that for Tuesday. As at first written in our book, and therefore-
we may fairly presume—as originally written in the exemplar, the conclusion was a mere
‘per’‚ no regard being paid to the necessary ‘eiusdem’ or ‘in unitate eiusdem’. The little
that 1 have to say about thls will be found in a postscript to the present chapter. See below,
p. clxxxii.
