PREFACE.

IT is now twelve or thirteen years since the textual peculiarities of the

Mass, at fol. 171 v, in honour of St Elfege first engaged my interest
in the document here made public. 1 believe the ‘De sancto Alfego
archiepiscopo' to be a direct transcript from the very page on which
Archbishop Lanfranc was plying his critical pen when it occurred to
him that he might, after all, have been mistaken in questioning the
claim of his heroic predecessor to the palm of martyrdom. But, evi-
dently the Mass is supplementary to the Missal itself. Evidently the
Missal itself is of more recent date than the pontificate of Lanfranc;
and, as evidently, it is not a Christchurch book. These three facts
suggest a very curious inference. 1 think that when, in the year 1105,
the body of St Elfege was brought to light a relic was given to the
monks of St Augustine’s; but that the latter, on asking for a Mass to
say in his honour, had to content themselves with the partially castigated
leaf which Lanfranc had cut out of the Christchurch Missal a quarter of
a century before, on the resolution of his doubts by Abbot Anselm of
Le Bec.

When, therefore, at the instance of my friend, the Reverend S. S.
Lewis, at that time and until his death the Librarian of Corpus Christi
College, Ι spent part of the Long Vacation of 1886 at Cambridge, it was
with unqualified pleasure that 1avai1ed myself of permission to tran·
scribe and work on a book of which l already knew a little, but was
anxious to know much more.

My study of the document began in the autumn of the following
year, but, with the exception of a few weeks‚ was intermitted from the
Christmas of 1889 to the summer of 1892, when some portions of the
following Introduction first fell into their present form.

The order, however, in which the Missal yielded up its several items
of evidence was uot that now given to the successive divisions of the
Introduction.

1 first of all collated the verbal text with that of six printed editions.
This was a wearisome task, for l had resolved to abstain as long as
possible from forming any theory as to the history of the book. My
