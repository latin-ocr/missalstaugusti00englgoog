above an integral number os lines as he approaches the end os a prayer
or presace. Sometimes the residuum is allowed to occupy the beginning
oi the next line3 sometimes it is accommodated at'the end, not the
beginning, ol the next line, the earlier portion oi which is reserved lor
the opening words of a new constituent and forits rubric. Now, when
the residuum happens to fall short by eve'r so little ol the lull comple-
ment ol one such line as 1 have imagined, the transcribet takes the
second ol these courses (unless, indeed, he be dealing with the last
constituent ol a mass); but, when it surpasses that complement he takes
the first The theory ol such an exemplar as 1 have imagined afsords
the simplest conceivable explanation ol this remarkable difference. ’

It will be seen, on comparing my resolution ol twenty lines ol the
Corpus book into the form which l believe their contents to have ex·
hibited in the Canterbury exemplar, that every several detail oi title,
antiphon, heading and residuary text finds its own proper place with a
spontaneity which cannot be fortuitous, which never yields an ‘error' ol
more than a letter or two, and which would have been impossible with
lines oi any other average content than nineteen letters. l say average
content, because the letter I is scarcely equivalent to the hall ol any
other letter, and because, as in the transcript, so, it must be presumed,
in the exemplar, the ungrammatical division ol a word was on no
account whatever tolerated¹. ,

But, I have been anxious to ascertain the number oi lines in a
page ol the exemplar whence the Corpus book was copied, and have no
doubt whatever that the number was twenty: ior these reasons :—

Ι. 1. Ats01.9v.,lin. 5, our copyist concludes the prayer ‘ Indignos
nos’ with ‘qui uiuis' instead ol ‘qui tecum uiuit’ an error which the
principal reviser has taken care to correct in the margin. The copyist’s
blunders', however, are so very rare and, save inthis instance, so very
slight, that Ι hesitate to hold him solely responsible lor so grave a lapse,
and incline to think that the prayer filled the last lines ol a page ol the
exemplar; but (i) that the writer oi that book, rather than let.‘.qui
tecum uiuit' travel up into another page,- had set it down in the form
ol some exceediugly compendious abbreviation which the copyist
misunderstood; or else (ii) that, though the whole or a part os ‘qui
tecum uiuit’ had once been visible in the original, the formula was by
this time obliterated by reason os much handling of the book.. The
latter is the more plausible alternative, for l find no authority sor the
