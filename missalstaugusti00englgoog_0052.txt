The questions lor us to answer, as each pair of rival readings comes
in its turn under review, will bez—ll one ol these be prae-Gregorian,
which is it? li both be Gregorian, which is the earlier and which
the later? And, should neither os these questions elicit a satisfactory
answer, there will yet remain a third; namely, ll one of these readings
be post-Gregorian, which is it?

Let me, then, begin with a group iu respect oi which an answer
to the first ol our three possible queries is aflorded us by the pages
oi the Verona codex. These instances are sufficient in number, lor
there are thirteen ol them, to bring clearly into view the subject os
the authenticity ol the Canterbury text, and ol its claim to represent
the maturer judgment ol St Gregory.

The first ol them occurs at fol. ιι v, lin. 7, in the postcommunion
os the midnight mass os the Nativity,-‘ Da nobis q. d. deus noster
ut qui natiuitatem d. n. i. c. nos frequentare gaudemus dignis conuersa-
tiouibus ad eius mereamur peruenire consortium! The contesting
‘pertinere' would seem in some ol the texts to have been changed
by a specious post-Gregorian effort into ‘pertingere'3 but ‘pertinere'
is a genuine prae-Gregorian reading, lor the Verona book (xa. i.)
exhibits the prayer word lor word as it stands in Menard, Muratori
and Pamelius. The phrase occurs, moreover, in the same sense-that
ol ‘to reach’-in another Christmas prayer (XL ix.) ol the same
collection, ‘Ut ad salutaris hodiernae generationis exordium pertinere
mereamur,' dac, and also in the two following :-‘ Respice...et ad tuam
misericordiam pertinentes...sustenta' (xvnl. xxxi.)-and, ‘Supplices te
rogamus...ut...ad uitam pertineamus aetemam¹’ (xvlll. ix). On the
other hand, 1 do not think that the Verona book acknowledges the
usual meaning ol ‘pertinere' in more than one place (xun. iv.)-
‘agnoscentes ad magnum pietatis tuae pertinere consilium.⁸

Ι need scarcely say that, as an editorial remedy ol some supposed
accident to the text, nothing could have been more commendable than
‘pertingere' ; or that, as an authentic substitution ol an usitate word lor
an obsolete, or os a better word sor a worse, nothing could be more
felicitous than ‘pemcnire,' ior it has the same rhythmic value aud the
same textual measurement as the vocablc it replaces. hut, in the
estimate ol St Gregory, ‘pertinere' cannot have been regarded as the
mutilated relic oi ‘pertingere' sor he must have known it to be genuine.
Are we then to regard ‘peruenire’ as a substitution oi his own? Is

¹ Curiously enough, the Ballerini have in this particular place been ill-advised enough to
substitute ‘pertingamus' for ‘pertineamus'
