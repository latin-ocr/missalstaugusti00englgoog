xcviii INTRODUCTION.

81), even il they be not corrections of clerical error, are slight and
unimportant.

How, then, account sor the sact that, while, of substantia] changes ol
text, the primitive Secretae os the Corpus MS. yield upwards of thirty
instances, and the primitive Postcommunions nearly as many, the
primitive Orationes yield only three, and that these are variants of
comparatively slight importance and interest?

The author of the Micrologus‚ speaking (cap. xxxl.) ol the Comes,
says, ‘cuius libri ordinem et sanctus Gregorius diligentissime obseruauit,
siue dum lectionibus et euangeliis missales orationes in sacramentario
adaptaret, siue dum antiphonas ex eisdem euangeliis quam plurimis
diebus in antiphonario articularet'3 and again (cap. m), ‘Sciendum
autem quod sanctus Gregorius ita ecclesiastica ordinauit officia ut prima
oratio in missa officio, lectioni et euangelio concordet' The explanation,
therefore, which 1 would hazard is, that the verbal recension exhibited in
other texts is a verbal recension made at that stage os the pontifl's
labours at which he brought the Orationes-of his several masses into
accord with the Antiphonary (‘ officio ’) and the Comes, or Lectionary
(lectioni et euangelio ’) ; in other words, (1) that the occasion sor
harmonizing the Orationes os his sacramentary with his antiphonary
and with the Comes was also the occasion chosen for giving thern their
verbal persecti0n3 but (2) that the verbal recension os his Secretae
and Postcommunions was deferred until such time as he should have
made some further progress with the Antiphonary, and (3) that the
Corpus MS. exhibits the outcome oi such recension. This explanation,
while it accounts not only lor the extreme paucity of variants
yielded by Orationes in the Corpus MS, accounts also sor their
extreme slightness, and for their absolute freedom srom all theologica}
significance.‘

Isaid on an earlier page that no evidence is so telling as unconscious
evidence. We here have another illustration ol the truth. Had the
verbal variants which distinguish the Corpus MS. from previously edited
copies os the Sacramentary been the work of some other pen than Gre-
gory’s, they surely would not have been found thickly distributed over
previous prayers and Secretae, over the compositions known as ‘Com-
municantes' and ‘Super Populum,' over Presaces and Postcommunions,
to the almost complete exception of Orationes. The fact of this
almost complete exception os the very class of constituents on
which, unless the author os the Micrologus was misinformed St Gregory
had already bestowed special attention, is a confirmatory prooi—if,
