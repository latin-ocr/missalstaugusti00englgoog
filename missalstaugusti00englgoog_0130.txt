but certainly not room for ten, impulsively, but providentially, made 'the
blunder which the vigilance ol the principal reviser has corrected lor us.

(ς) But, indeed, he seems to have neglected, in like manner with
the final utu of the ‘ Indignos nos,’ the last syllable ol each os the two
previous prayers, and that ol the prayer which follows ln each, that is

to say, ol the four cases he, on nearing the end ol a line ol his own,
dropped a last syllable which in the exemplar must have been detached
from its context and lodged apart ’

Page ix. ol the exemplar affords proos of my theory.

The five lines in our volume, beginning with the sixteenth ol sol. 9v.
and ending with the twentieth, resolve themselves easily enough into
ten short uncial lines. They contain 184 letters. But when we come
to sol. ιο we lind that something has gone wrong. 'The contentos the
second and third lines is no multiple ol eighteen or nineteen letters,-
and the lourth and filth comprise ninety-one instead ol seventy·three or

presume, in order to bring his work ‘up to date '—that disturbed our
mercurial artist, and caused him to make his lines first too light, and
then too heavy, till good luck set things right at last. This happened
at the end ol the Oratio. The latter hali oi Page ix, comprising, like'
the first 184 letters, must have be‘en somewhat as lollows :-
