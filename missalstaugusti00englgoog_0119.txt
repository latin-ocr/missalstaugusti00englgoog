next page, he tells υς, upon the authority ol the ‘De locis sanctis
martyrum,' stood ‘septimo milliario ab urbe‚' he makes the following
marvellous comment—⁴ Verum illud, Romae milliario sexta, mendosum
uidetur, curn apud Florentinium sit, Romae milites 6, et horum mentio
in aliis quoque habeatur. ltaque priora illa uerba alio spectant et cor-
rupta sunt¹.'

Meanwhile, however, and while the memory of the thing had been
only not completely blotted out of the martyrologies, there were two
documents in which the annual solemnity proper to the old basilica, the
more ancient anniversary of the thirtieth of September, stood recorded.

One of them was the Verona manuscript (xlm), which, under the
heading, ‘Prilia Kalendas Octobris. Natale basilicae angeli in Salaria}
gives us four masses in honour oi St Michael and one in honour of
the angels The most singular feature in these is the frequent recurrence ,
ol the words ‘uenerari' and ‘ueneratio'; thus-‘pro ueneratione eius oblata
qui,’ ‘cum illa sit digna namuri: ‘in angelicae mneratane substantiae,'
‘ubi quos maceramur assistunt,' ‘pia semper ueneratimte laetetur'.'
Although, therefore, ‘ueneratio' has no place in the Verona title, there
can be no question that the dominant idea of the annual solemnity on
the Salarian Way was that of the veneration of the augels, as dis·
tinguished from the festive commemoration of the saints

The other document was that which formed the basis of the Corpus
MS. The title of the mass as there preserved to us is, not ‘Dedicatio
basilicae sancti Michaelis,’ but ‘In ueneratione sancti Michaelis
archangeli,’ and thus absolutely distinguishes and separates the sant·
augustinian celebration from that of the printed texts, which agree
in making their feast the anniversary of the finding, or the consecration,
oi a ehurch. The further fact that the mass had been assigned, not to
the twenty-ninth, but to the thirtieth of September, is indicated, as we
have seen, by the ablative·case title'of the mass for St Honorius.

Ι doubt il, with tlte sole exception of the Corpus MS, any sacra·
mentary or missal claiming the name of Gregorian bein existence which
retains a record of the old ‘Veneratio' of St Michael, to the exclusion of
the superseding feast. Be that as it may, its presence in the Corpus MS.
