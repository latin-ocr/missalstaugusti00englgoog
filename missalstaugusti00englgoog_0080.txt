lxviii turnonucrrou.

santet namque se prauis actionibus polluunt et super hoc uindictam
iusti iudicii retribui posse diffidunt!

Again, he says (xxt xiv.) ‘Qui uenturum iudicem cogitat indesi-
nenter quotidie rationum suarum in melius causas parat’ But, when
(xxw. xxv.) he tells the judge presiding in his court to turn his thoughts
without fail to the Judge under whose eye he himself now appears, and
by whom he must himself one day be judged, he resorts to ‘incessanter,'
because (so at least it seems to me) the idea of altemation creeps in-
when such and such a thing is done, then let not such and such another

thing fail to be done: ‘Cumque iudicanti ei a caeteris foris assistitur
uigilanti oculo incessanter aspiciat cui quandoque iudici ipse de his
iudicandus assistat!

We seem, then, in St Gregory’s ‘incessanter’ to touch upon some
such idea as that of immediate response to recurring challenges, in·
variable obedience to recurring impulses, and the like. And what 1
know of the latinity of the ‘Moralia' justifies this opinion; for, though

he tells us that a river flows ‘indesinenter '-‘ uita praesens...indesinenter
ad terminum suum...quasi impulsu fluminis ducitur' (xx. xiv.)-the
word he chooses to describe the progress of a worm is ‘incessanter,‘
because (xvl. lxix.) worms move in unvarying response to a succession of
jerks:—‘ naturae est uermium momentis singulis incessanter moveri'

Similarly, he says (xxn. vi.) ‘More itaque uiatorum nequaquam
debemus aspicere quantum iam iter peregimus, sed quantum superest ut
peragamus, ut paulisper fiat praeteritum quod indesinenter et timide ad·
huc attenditur futurum '-·-that that may gradually become a past thing
which is now a future. But, speaking of the ‘status immortalitatis’ of
the unfallen Adam, as contrasted with the ‘cursus mortalitatis' of the
fallen, he says (xxv. iii.) ‘eius cursum nascendo sortimur, ut eo ipso
quotidiano momento quo uiuimus incessanter a uita transeamus, et
uiuendi nobis spatium unde crescere creditur inde decrescat'-‘in such
wise that, in virtue of that very advance in living which we make from
day to day, we, as an inevitable consequence, pass away from life; and
precisely as our span seems to lengthen so it shortens,’ the ‘incessanter’
of the first portion os the sentence having its counterpart in the ‘unde...
inde’ of the second.

In the following passage (XXX. it) we find ‘semper' in the sense of
‘on every given occasion' used as the equivalent of ‘incessanter’; and
the same word in the sense of ‘evermore' used as the equivalent of
‘indesinentes' Commenting on the words ‘Nunquid mittes fulgura et
ibunt, et reuertentes dicent tibi, Adsumusl', he says ‘flumina reuertun-
