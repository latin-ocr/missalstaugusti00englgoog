INTRODUCTION.

Tne Ennsuo Pnsrncss.

No fewer than fifty-five Prefaces have been erased from the Proprium
de Tempore Only fifteen remain. Ol these fifteen, three had been
marked with a marginal obelus, and owe their escape to the fact, as it
would appear, that, the masses to which they belong being adventitious,
the Gregorian Antiphonary offered no offin'a to take their place. of the
twelve which thus seem to survive by right ol survival, three are dupli·
cates. The survivors by right ol survival, thus nine in number, are:-

1. ‘Cuius hodie faciem,’ &c (sol. 10 u), 2. ‘Quia per incamati,’ ae.
(loll. 11, 12 u), 3. ‘Quia nostri saluatoris,’ &c (sol. 12), 4 ‘Quia cum
unigenitus,’ &c (sol. 17), 5. ‘Qui corporali ieiunio,' &c (fol. 20),
6. ‘Quem in hac nocte,' &c (fol. 35 a), 7. ‘Et te quidem‚' &c (soll.
41, 46), 8. ‘Qui post resurrectionem,' &c (fol. 51v.)‚ 9. ‘Qui ascen·
dens,' &c (soll. 5311, 54).

ln the Proprium Sanctorum all but thirteen have been erased, and
as many as ten os these are condemned by the marginal obelus. The
unmarked survivors are the Preface for the Nativity (Quia per incar·
nati,' dcc.) at fol. 78 v, the Preface, at fol. 111 v, in honour ol the Blessed
Virgin, recently imposed on the Westem Church by Urban 11. at the
time when the Corpus MS. was executed, and one, at sol. 137 v, beginning
with the words ‘Qui aecclesiam tuam'

After the Proprium Sanctorum we have, at fol. 138, the mass ‘In
dedicatione aecclesiae' lts Preface remains, and remains uncondemned,
as though it possessed a claim to survival which had been respected by
the monks ol St Augustine's.

Then come eleven Missae de Communi (t'ol. 138 v.-143 a). The
six Prefaces sound in these have, all of them, been condemned ; and op-
posite the first os them, at fol. 139 v, is a memorandum directing the
substitution of the ‘Qui aecclesiam tuam' which had been spared at
fol,137'v.

After this we have a promiscuous group os votive masses. Some os
them have an Epistle and Gospel, sour of them have a Preface. The
four Prelaces are uncondemned, notas it would seem, because the
owners of the book recognised in them a claim to survival‚ but, simply,
because this group os masses was. not reviewed with an eye to the
Prefaces. When the reviser sound himsell at the end ol the Gregorian

exemplar, he closed the book and laid down the style. .
of the three unmarked and unerased Prefaces in the Proprium
Sanctorum, the first has already been recorded. There remain there·
