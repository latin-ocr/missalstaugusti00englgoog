superadded tu. The most plausible account, then, to be given of
our ‘susceptor meus es' would be, 1 apprehend, that St Gregory found
it in the Roman Psalter and employed it in each of his redactions; but
that the more idiomatic ‘susceptor meus es tu' is a post-redactional
improvement.

So, too, with Ps. 121, v. 7, a passage occurring in the ‹ffa'um for
Mid-lent Sunday. lt is the last which l have to notice in this connexion,
and gives further warrant to the conclusion that our ‘intrate’ our ’
‘susceptor meus es,' our ‘perient' and our ‘illic...ascenderunt’ were the
original readings of the three redactions, and that they owe their escape
from supersession to the fact that the parent document of the offia'a
containing them left Rome before that further textual revision took
place the outcome of which is to be seen in the Pamelian and the Pio·
Clementine books. And this view may reasonably, I think, be taken
on most, if not all, of the remaining instances. If, however, 1 shall be
thought to have made good my contention in respect ol these six, I
shall be content

It would have been so strange and so unlikely a reversal of the
proper order of things for St Gregory to supersede ‘non peribit in
aetemum' by ‘non peribit in finem,' ‘introite’ by ‘intrate' ‘peribunt'
by ‘perient‘ ‘illuc ascenderunt' by 'illic ascenderunt,’ ‘saluum me
facias' by ‘saluum facias' ‘inimicos meos’ by ‘inimicos' ‘sperent
in eo' by ‘sperent in eum,' as to leave us no escape from the
conclusion, that, of the several pairs of conflicting readings comprised in
Class D, some represent the stage of textual improvement reached by
St Gregory at the date of the third ascertained redaction, whilst others
represent a later stage, a stage at which, for whatever reason, the
document whence our excerpts are derived was not enabled to
participate in corrections introduced into the parent copies of the
Pamelian Antiphonary and the Pio-Clementine Gradual. The reason 1
venture to suggest is, that the parent of our excerpts had by that time
reached its new home in the kingdom of Kent

Tuming from the excerpts to the missal itself, 1 find one or two
details which must be recorded as briefly as may be :-

At fol 69v. we find ·ῑ)()“Μ.ΧΧ.ΠΙ.’ instead of &OEAEme
followed by ‘Ji’ without an antiphonarial indication. At fol 70
‘ffimxxllll' instead of ‘DUM . xxnl1.‚' followed by ‘R’ without an
antiphonarial indication. At fol. 70 v. ‘DUM . xv? instead of ‘15OE
xxv.,' followed by an antiphonarial indication of post-Gregorian in·
sertion, but no ‘fh’
