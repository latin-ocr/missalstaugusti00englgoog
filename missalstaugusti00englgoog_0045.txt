Nor are we without light and guidance sor the seventh century.
The Salzburg ‘Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae¹,' a document already
quoted, gives the name ol ‘sancta Caecilia’ to a church on the south
side ol the Appian Way which a slightly later document, the Salzburg
‘De locis sanctis martyrum²,' mentions as the ‘ecclesia sancti Sixti
papae! This variation ol title, though it does not prove that the body
ol Caecilia had in time past been translated lrom some other catacomb
to the range ol galleries in which Pope Sixtus lay, raises at any rate a
presumption in favour ol the view; and that presumption is very
singularly confirmed by certain conflicting statements in the various
accounts ol the happy discovery made by Paschal⁸. But, however this
may be, the earlier ol the two Salzburg lists speaks oi St Caecilia's
testing-place in such a way as to imply that, although it was believed to
be somewhere underground in the vicinity ol the church known some·
times by her name sometimes by that ol St Sixtus, it was not accessible
to sight and frequentation. Adequately to explain my meaning 1
should have to transcribe the ‘Notitia’ in lull, dwelling one by one on
its successive entries; but this would be impracticable, nor will l
affront my readers by doing what they would lain do for themselves,
Let it suffice me, therefore, to quote the sentences contextual to the
notice ol St Caecilia-

‘Deinde peruenies ad sanctum Gordianum martyrem, cuius corpus
requiescit sub altare magno in ecclesia sancti Epimachi [here the precise

²Prinled as au appendix to Alcuin’s works. See Migne,c1. 1359, 1361 c. De Rossi
(‘ Roma Sotteranea Cristiana,’ 1. ¹45) assigns it to the pontificate ol Honorius 1. (ab. 626
cira—639 cira).

² Migne, cr. 13631).

³ The Liber Pontifioalis says [fl 438] that Paschal found it ‘in coemeterio Praetextati! The
explorations anrl the genius oi the commendatore de Rossi have proved beyond doubt that he
found it in the cemetery ol St Sixtus. The pontiil's own letter describing the event, as
published by Mausi, aud alter him by Migne (011. 1087 c), says ‘properantes in coemeterium
sancti Sixti seu Praetextati situm ioris portam Appiam (sicut in sacratissima illius passione
manifeste narratur) inter collegas episcopos...reperimas’ Α sennon ol the pontili's, as pub·
lished by Batonius, and aher him by the Bollandists (Aa Ss. xvr. 396), says 'quod etiam (sc.
corpus)...in coemeterio S. sisti episcopi soris portam Appiam (sicut in sacratissima illius
passione manifeste narratur) inter collegas episcopos...reperimus.'

My owu belielis that Paschal wrote ‘properantes iu coemeterium sancti Sixti situm ioris
portam Appiam inter collegas episcopos...reperimus’; but that some scribe or editor, misled by
the Passio, and unaware that there had ever been a translation ol the corpse, intruded into the
letter a gloss ol his own, ‘seu Praetextati, sicut in sacratissima illius passione manifeste narratur,'
the adverbial clause being added as ajustilication ol the ‘seu Praetextati’5 thal ihss &¹⁰⁸⁵
was incorporated into the text ol the serm0n3 and that a later scribe, to whom the Passio
was unknown, but who saw the absurdity ol assigning two distinct sites to one event, and,
