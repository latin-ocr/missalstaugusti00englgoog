as the mass for the lesser litanies which had been instituted in the year
59o' lf this be so, it is quite possible that the missionary himself may,
in accordance with the well-known instructions given him by St Gregory,
have transferred it to the Monday before the Ascension, out of compli-
inent to the Gallican Church‚ which on that day celebrated the first of
its three annual rogatione.

These details must be carefully noted and borne in mind if we would
duly appraise the intemal evidence of the verbal text'on which l shall
have to dwell at some length in another chapter. But the very noting of
them brings its own reward by casting a ray or two of light on the
previous history of the contents of our sacramentary.

' lf the Corpus document be what 1 think it, it is either a copy of
some earlier manuscript which comprised, like itself, the contents of St
Augustine’s liber missalis and, intermingled with them, the accretions of

subsequent centuries, or it is a first coadunation of primitive and of
adventitious elements. The former of these two hypotheses is the less
probable; for it is not likely that in such earlier manuscript as it
presupposes the anachrouous collocation we have noticed of the three
messes on foll. 14 o. and 15 would have been allowed to remain un-
rectified.

Now, assuming the scribe or rubricator of the Corpus book to have

been working upon two documents, one of them a Gregorian missal
in the strict sense of the word ‘Gregorian’-that 'is to say, a volume
containing none but masses of Gregorian redaction—and the other a
missal containing adventitious as well as primitive work; assuming him,

l say, to have worked on two such documents, which for convenience’ ’
sake l shall call No. 1 and No. 2, what do we find? We find

1. That when the moment came for him to defiect for the first time
from the plain and steady sequence of No. 1 and turn to No. 2 for the
Antiphon of the first adventitious mass (fol. '14v., lin. 2), he made, not
indeed his first blunder‚ but his first extra-textual blunder‚ and instead
of writing ‘Puer natus est’ wrote something else, now erased and
superseded.

2. After this all goes well till we reach fol. 17, lin. 8 and the title
of another adventitious mass, that for the Octave of the Epiphany;
when, as though unconsciously disturbed by a check to the even
sequence of the monotonous task of a merely mechanical transcription

¹ And it is just possible that St Augustine aud his monks may on the Monday before
Ascensionday have entered Canterbury, siuging their ‘Deprecamur te Domine-⁹ See Beda,
H. E. 1. 25. In 597 the Monduy before Ascensionday fell on the tventieth of May.
