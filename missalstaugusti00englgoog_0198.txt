the adoption of which would have defeated the very end proposed by
those changes in foliation, cannot with any show of probability be set
down as anything else than St Gregory’s working copy of D. There is,
as we have repeatedly seen in the foregoing chapters, very much to
encourage the deductiori of this inference; there is nothing to set against
it; and the minute and varied testimony yielded by the idiosyncrasies
of the scribe who transferred the contents of the exemplar to the pages

of the Corpus MS, is such as to lift the inference to the level of a
conclusion morally certain.

POSTSCRIPT.

One or two miscellaneous items must here be added. They may
perhaps serve as starting-points for future studente.

Ι. l have already noted¹ the absence of a necessary ‘eiusdem'
from the conclusion of a prayer in a mass of Gregorian compilation.
The only other instance occurs at fol. 28 v, lin. 5. The scribe of the
Corpus MS. was so conscientious a workman that l am disposed to see
in these exceptions toa rule otherwise observed most carefully a proof
in favour of the theory of a working copy. In neither case is it the
principal reviser who has made good the defect. ln neither case,
therefore, must we necessarily think that the defect was made good
from a finished transcript. Each correction may, l venture to think,
be very plausibly referred to a note introduced into the margin of
the exemplar, but overlooked by the scribe.

11. On the nineteenth Sunday of the post-pentecostal group‚ and
not infrequently thenceforward, our transcriber omits the rubric of the
first prayer of a mass, But, before the point just indicated, it is, with
one solitary exception, only at the very foot of a page that he omits
any minor rubric whatever. In other words; although, iu the course of
a hundred and twenty-five pages, he now and then at the extreme end
of a page forgets a minor rubric, the fault occurs only once in any other
