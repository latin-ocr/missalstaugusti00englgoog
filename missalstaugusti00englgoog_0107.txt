INTRODUCTION. xcv

ending at fol. 96, lin. 13. ‘The phrase ‘fore placatum’ isin admirable
balance with the antecedent ‘uenturum esse,’ but it is a phrase peculiar
to the Corpus MS. The reading of the Verona book (x111.ii.)and
os previous editions generally is ‘fauere' In Pamelius, however, it
has been changed to ‘fieri'

Again, the two saints, John and Paul, of the Coelian Hill, who, as we
know from the evidence of the Verona book (xlv), were held in high
honour by the Roman Church before the time of Gregory, were not
allowed to fall into oblivion during his pontificate; for one of his ·
homilies (the thirty-fourth on the Gospels) was preached in their
basilica lt is, therefore, without surprise that we find in the Secreta
given to their festum (fol. 97 v, lin. 2) just that sort of two-sold improve-
ment which marks the Secreta of the mass for St Marcellus, an improve-
ment instances of which have already been yielded by our Proprium
de Tempore. In the Verona book (vm xxviii.) the prayer reads
thus:-‘ Hostias tibi, Domine, sanctorum tuorum dicatas meritis benig·
nus assume et ad perpetuum nobis tribue prouenire subsidium! At the
time of Redaction B the only change was the addition of ‘Iohannis et
Pauli’ to ‘sanctorum tuorum’; it was the recension represented by the
Corpus MS. that substituted ‘auxilium' for the final word of the phrase,
thus recalling to us the ‘infirmitatis auxilium' at fol. 55 u, lin. 7. And,
certainly, St Gregory’s own use of the word ‘subsidium’ would seem to
elucidate and justify the supersession of the word in the present instance.
For his ‘subsidium' is that which being administered wards off weakness
and, it may be, death [‘ fames carnis est subtractum subsidium carnis,'
v1. xxvii.], not that which augments vigour and prolongs life [‘ Cumque
carnis subsidia reserando trepidus praeparat, ab alimentis miseri·
cordiae animam necat; et cum pati in terra inopiam metuit aeternam
sibi abundantiam supernae refectionis abscindit,' vll. xxvi.], and is, in its
proper sense, at least, of but passing service [‘ temporali refouentur
subsidio, sicut uiator in stabulo utitur lecto,' V11. liv.]¹.

If we are to believe the author of the ‘Micrologus (cap. xL11.), the
commemoration of St Paul on the thirtieth of June was instituted by St
Gregory-‘Sanctus Gregorius papa festum sancti Pauli...uoluit obseruari'

Gregory cannot, therefore, be supposed (at fol. 99, lin. 12) to have
superseded the ‘interuenientibus' of his own selection by the textually
equivalent ‘intercedentibus' out of any dislike to the earlier word;
indeed, at fol. 133 u, lin. 3, we encounter the converse change of ‘inter-
