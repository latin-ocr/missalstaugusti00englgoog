revising pen of Gregory the Great, it is the form peculiar to the· Corpus
MS.¹ ’

Ι said just now that Menard, Muratori and Pamelius are in exact
verbal agreement with the Verona book. They are as regards the Post·
communion itself, but not as regards the conclusion appended to it ln
this, as in many places, the Verona book adds ‘Per’ to a prayer which
would more appropriately end with ‘Qui tecum! l shall revert to the
subject on a later page.

ln the second instance, at fol. 14, lin. 5, the very slightness of the
difference between the readings seems to lend importance to it One
form of the Secreta for Holy innocents' Day is ‘Sanctorum tuorum
domine pia non desit oratio, quae et munera nostra tibi conciliet et tuam
nobis indulgentiam semper optineat'; the other differs from it by the
mere absence of ‘tibi’ The balance of the fuller form is so exquisitely
perfect that it is hard to believe that scribes, however indolent, could
have failed to notice and, noticing‚ to respect it, had it been the older
reading. The shorter form, however, is that not only of all previously
edited MSS, but, before them, of the Verona book itself (xxm. vi).

At foi. 15, lin. 9 the words ‘per intercessionem...Mariae’ bring
the Secreta so admirably into harmony with the other two constituents
of the mass ‘de Sancta Maria,’ that it is hard to regard its absence from
other MSS. as the result of an omission of words originally inherent
to it. That it is an imported improvement would seem to be certain
from the fact that it is not in the Verona text (xxxll. iii.)

The fourth instance occurs at fol. 21, lin. 15, in the Secreta for the
Saturday after Ash-Wednesday. ln the Verona book (111111. ii.) it reads
thus :-‘ Suscipe Domine sacrificium cuius te uoluisti dignanter immo-
latione placari‚ et praesta, quaesumus, ut huius operatione mundati
beneplacitum tibi nostrae mentis offeramus affectum' The ‘et' before
‘praesta' would seem to have disappeared at an earlier revision. But

if it be true that in the fust of the prayers we have been considering
Gregory replaced ‘pertinere’ at his leisure, and at a comparatively late
date, by a word of equivalent measurement, it may also be the fact
that it was not upon a first review of the ‘Suscipe Domine sacrificium’
that he replaced ‘offeramus affectum' by a phrase of equal textual
content but of higher grammatica! merit For, suitable as ‘offeramus
affectum’ might be in a Postcommunion‚ there can be no doubt that the
