Here, then, 1 close the present chapter, convinced that such instances
of bad or faulty diction as occur in the Proprium Sanctorum of the
Corpus MS. are confined to masses which had no place iu the libri
missales of St Augustine and his companions, and that the instances
peculiar to it of a converse character occur mainly, if not exclusively,

in masses ol St Gregory’s cognizance.
Our attention must now be turned to other subjecta.

Assuming, then, the existence at St Augustine's Abbey at Canterbury
of a primitive and parent book characterized, as to such of its masses as
were of Gregorian redaction, by a singular purity of verbal text and by
an unbroken consistency of rubrication, the question at once arises, Was
this primitive and parent book old enough to have been brought to
Canterbury in the year 597?

Two problems lie before us, that of a terminus ad quem, and that of a
terminus a quo. As to the former, the case may be stated thus, Does
the primitive book revealed to us by the Corpus MS. yield evidence
’ consistent with the theory of so early a date as the year 596? As to
the latter, we must remember that if our mass for St Caecilia was
indeed part and parcel of the primitive book, then each of the claims
which 1 have advanced for the primitive book is vitiated, both that of
pure verbal text and that of consistent titulati0n; and the case must be
stated as follows, Does the primitive book revealed to us by the Corpus
MS. yield evidence of a date so late in the pontificate of St Gregory as
that the sepulchral chamber ol St Caecilia had already been closed, her
festum suspended, and the mass in her honour eliminated from the
Sacramentary?

The present chapter is concemed with the first named of these two
problema

Two conditions more stringent than a pure verbal text and a »

faultless technique could not be laid down in respect of a missal fresh
issued from the papal scriptorium. And, if it be true that the primitive
and parent book possessed the faultless talarique and the pure text,
before what year must it have been completed?

1. As regards lapses of style, the record collected in the preceding
chapter is by no means a slight one; but the earliest mass in which an
offending word is to be found is that of SS. Primus and Felician (fol.
