INTRODUCTION. ’ clxxxi

D'. lt is part and parcel of that batch of text which he recombined,
when, cancelling the erewhile mass ol SS. Felicissimus and Agapitus and
substituting one mass for two on the neighbouring feast of St Laurence¹,
he abstracted text of the value of a leaf from the middle of the Proprium
Sanctorum. Again l say, This sort of thing cannot be fortuitous.
Besides, we see the reason of it. The Secreta which now serves for the
joint feast of SS. Sixtus, Felicissimus and AgapituS, is not precisely
that of theold separate festum of St Sixtus. It is the same prayer, but
the same prayer amplitied by th‘e ablative clause ‘intercedentibus sanctis
tuis’ and lengthened—needlessly lengthened, except that the addition
enhanced the augmentation to the extent of two whole lines-by the
very curious extension ‘dffn . nn*n . ihm? This double amplification

θ rendered necessary a compensating deductiori ol text at some early

moment; because, except for such deduction, the newly chosen pair of
, masses would now have been too long by a line. What the figures
were before the change we already know They were, in terms of
letters,-

l352÷370÷399÷398)-(415÷376l=1519-791=728=39>< 18&
and, in terms of lines,—
(19÷20÷21÷21)-(22÷20)=81 -4²=39·

What St Gregory wanted was, of course, a nett deduction of 40
lines Clearly, therefore, something must be done, and what that
something was the marginal note on fol. 109 v. informs us. He on
St Laurence’s Day substituted the Secreta ‘Accipe q. d. munera' for his
first choice, the ‘Sacrificium nostrum,' or 110 letters for 121. This was
enough. The figures now were, in terms ol letters,—

(352÷370÷399÷398)-l415÷36sl=1519-780=739=40><18ll;
and, in terms of lines,-
(19÷20÷2r÷21)-(22÷rp)=81-41=40.

lf it be true that the book in which the reviser of the Corpus MS.
found material for correcting two manifest stichometrical errors incurred
in the prosecution of those changes in the loliation of Redaction D, of
which the Corpus MS. is witness· if,I say, it be true that the standard
of revision of the Missal of St Augustine'S, Canterbury, was a fair copy
of Subredaction D'; the book where the errors stood on record, errors
