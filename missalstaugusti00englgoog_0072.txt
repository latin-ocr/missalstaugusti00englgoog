lx 1011000011011.

The ‘Hostia haec' at 101. 26 v., lin. 1 does not call 101 special remark.
But at 101. 25, 110. 16 we have another instance 01 the care taken in our
book to give their proper endings to prayers addressed to the Second
and Third Persons 01 the Holy Trinity. One would suppose that the
proper ‘in unitate eiusdem' had 001 had a place in the prae-Gregorian
prayer.

This addition may, just possibly, have suggested, as Ι hope to shew
10 another chapter, the very interesting suppression, at 101. 1510110. 18,
01 the word ‘aeternae' in the Ρο510010101101001011110 Friday 01101 the
Second Sunday in Lent. The motive 101 the suppression 01 1110
adjective in such a phrase as ‘accepto pignere salutis aeternae’ must, Ι
think, have been that which at 101. 22, lin. 19 made ‘augmentum'
instead 01 ‘effectum’ the correlative 01 ‘pignus' in the phrase ‘salutaris
pignus'3 the 1001 that the salvation 01 which the divine mysteries convey
the earnest is a salvation that begins in this lise, 001 10 1110 next-an
idea categorically expressed both 101110 Communio and in the Super
Populum 01 the present mass, ‘Tu Domine seruabis nos...a generatione
hac in aeternum,’ ‘Da q. d. populo tuo salutem mentis et 00100115 ut
bonisoperibus inherendo' lire.¹

This is the only instance in which a noticeable word has been boldly
dropped by the editor 01 the parent text 01 our volume; and our
transcriber, to whom the received verbal text 01 the prayers 01 the mass
was, 001100111001100110101011101,0001115000 by reason 01 the 100110 11ον0
been betrayed into the very sort 01 inadvertence traces 01 which are
found at 101. 1411, 101. 17,101. 1711, 101. 18, and 101. 70 0. Puzzled at
encountering ‘pignere salutis’ instead 01 ‘pignere salutis aeternae,’ he
all unconsciously wrote nothing but 1 pignere,' leaving it to a reviser to
interlineate the missing word.

¹ But where there is no such word 15 1 pignus‚'and therefore no possibility 01 00011101 between
two such different ideas as that 01 1 pignus’ in the sense 01 10511101001 01 something begun iu this
1110 and that 01 ‘pignus’ 10 the sense 01 pledge 01 something to be begun when time is over, the
phrase ‘salutis aeternae 'is more than welcome in our book. Witnees the Oratio 101 St John
1110 Baptist's Day (101. 960. 110. 8), where 101 the 000-6100011110 ‘salutis et pacis' we read
‘salutis aeternae!

1 need not remind the reader that the ‘uitam aeternam’ 01 000 01 the Creeds has its equi·
valent in the ‘uitam uenturi saeculi' 01 another. ‘l’he following quotation from the Verona
book (11111. xlii.) illustrates ‘aeternitas’ in the sense, not 01 something beginning now and con-
tinued ad infinitum. 01 01 something beginning at any other time and continued ad infinitum,
but 01 something proper to the 0011 world, something proper to the 1110 10 00010 :—‘ Pugnanit
