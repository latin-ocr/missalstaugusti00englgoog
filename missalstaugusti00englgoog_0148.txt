The slow solvent of a patient examination has provided a super·
abundantly satisfactory answer to that question, and in a way little
dreamed of when 1 took the task in hand.

The stichometry of the earlier pages of our volume justifies us in
believing it to have been the intention of St Gregory that throughout the
Proprium de Tempore of the mass-books which his missionaries brought
to Canterbury every mass for which an officium was provided in the
companion volume of the Antiphonary should carry an intimation of
the fact in the shape of a brief memorandum inserted immediately after
the heading, or capitulum. The memorandum consisted of the first
words, or even the first syllables merely, of the Antiphona, the first
constituent of the fficium. Ἴ

lt would seem, therefore, to have been both natural and congruous
that when dealing with adventitious masses our transcribet should also
preface such of thern as could boast offia'a with a like indication of their
respective Antiphonae.

Besides these two categories there is a third consisting of some few
primary masses-l am still speaking of the Proprium de Tempore-to
which St Gregory had not assigned officia, but which in course of time
came to possess them. These Gregorian masses, as they appear in our
volume, are prefaced‚ each of them, with an indication of the post·
Gregorian Antiphone thus attributed to it.

The consequence is, that in our Proprium de Tempore there are
almost as many indicated Antiphonae as masses. But the number of
inserted afficta is very much smaller, because these only occur-at least
after fol. 8-where it was possible to find accommodation for them upon
blank erasures created by the obliteration of condemned Prefaces. But
-l am still speaking of the Proprium de Tempore—wherever a Preface
has been condemned it has been expunged, except on the first Sunday
after Christmas·Day, the third after the Octave of the Epiphany and
that next before Advent; and all expunged Prefaces are replaced by
the corresponding efficia, except on Passim-Sunday, Palm-Sunday and

the eighteenth in the post-pentecostal series. Three, however, of these
six days had no ‹ffcium in St Gregory’s own Antiphonary.

Now, when l peruse the long series of antiphonarial indications
prefixed to the several Sunday masses of Gregorian cognizance l find
