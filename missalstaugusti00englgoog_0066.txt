liv INTRODUCTION.

Even as developed and elucidated by the antiphonary, neither ol the
two masses to which reference has just been made as containing ‘pra-
uitas nostra' has a distinctly penitential and sels-afflictive character.
Hope and confidence are their hey-note There is nothing in them to
oblige, or even to invite, the assumption that in the Secreta ‘Haec
munera...ct uincula nostrae prauitatis absoluant et tuae uobis miseri·
cordiae dona concilient' the words ‘uincula nostrae prauitatis' are to be
understood os grievous actual sin rather than os that srailty and proneness
to evil, exemption srom which cannot be claimed by the best os men,
though, but lor it, there would be no actual sin. But, on the other hand,
the mass for the Saturday in the winter ember·weel‹ speaks in unmis
takeable terms ol ‘peccati iugum‚' of ‘actionis propriae culpa,' of
‘flamma uitiorum'; and, in the phrase ‘qui iuste pro peccatis nostris
affligimur,' distinctly avers that our sins provolce the accurately gauged
punishment with which we are visited in our afflictions. The ‘actio
nostra' ol the Corpus MS. is thus in exact harmony with this ‘actionis
propriae culpa'3 and its ‘ex nostra actione affligimur’ with this ‘pro pec-
catis nostris affligimur.’ But no such harmony can be discerned between
expressions like ‘nostra prauitas' or ‘ex nostra prauitate affligimur'
and the two phrases just quoted, unless or until we shall understand
by ‘prauitas’ actual sin as distinguished lrom proneness to evil.

Now, there cannot be the shadow os a doubt that there was a prae·
Gregorian use of ‘prauitas' in the sense ol actual, as distinguished from
original, sin; lor the Verona book (XXIX. xv.) has ‘Quaesumus omnipo
tens Deus, ne multitudinem nostrae prauitatis attendas, sed a peccatis
abstrahe...uoluntates.’ But there is no reason to believe that St Gregory
attached that meaning to the word, to the exclusion os every other
meaning; and the account Ι would suggest ol the ‘actione’ under
consideration is, that he made it take the place ol ‘prauitate’ in order
thus to elucidate the truth that we are punished lor our evil conduct,
and that actual sin is visited in the afflictions that belal the regenerate.

And, indeed, a comparison of the passages in which ‘affligimur’
occurs only serves to confirm the conjecture that (1) ‘actione’ is the
later reading ol the two, and that (2) it was made to take the place os
⁴ prauitate' lor some such reason as l have intimated :—
