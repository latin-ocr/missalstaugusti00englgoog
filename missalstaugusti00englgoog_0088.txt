ment of it? 11 thisbe so, the absence of ‘Et' is accounted for both
simply and reasonably.

11 would perhaps be impossible, it certainly would be difficult, to
form an approximately true estimare of the comparative ages of all the
Prefaces, taken one by one, of the Verona book ; and were that feasible,
we should still have to face the further task of ascertaining the

precise date of the oldest of them. But the comparatively simple
course of noting their grammatioel features may give us a serviceable

eluelo connect the long lllation ‘Vere dignum...aeteme Deus' with a

Preface, an illative particle may be employed (eg. ‘A tua enim nun-
quam est laude cessandum '), or a relative pronoun (cg. ‘Ad cuius im·
mensam pertinet gloriam ')‚ or a participle (eg. ⁴13. Ioannis apostoli
gloriam recensentes ’); or, the two phrases may be simply linked
together by the conjunction ‘Et’

Now, curiously enough, 1 lind, on referring to Mr Wilson's invaluable
‘Index to Roman Sacramentaries,' that this last is the very method
which is least of all affected in the Verona book. 11 cannot be a for-
tuitous fact that out of the seventy·live Prefaces beginning with ‘Et'
in Mr Wilson’s list (pp. 2-4) none are notitied as Gelasian, and only
two as Leonian, and that the construction of one of these two is so
unusualms to render its evidence useless That is to say, from end to
end of the ‘Leonian’ sacramentary only one Preface can be fairly
said to begin with ‘Et' We may, therefore, feel morally certain that
previous editions are right in not giving us the word; that here, as in
other instances, they merely perpetuate the prae-Gregorian usage; and
that here, as in other instances, ours is a later reading than the prae·
Gregorian.

The question now arises,1s it a Gregorian reading? One would
think so. For it occurs twice, at fol. 41 and again at fol 46, and is in
each case preceded by the word ‘aeterne' which proves that the use 01
the long Illation had been contemplated3 and it has the support of a
like rendering, at fol. 41 0.,01 the Praefatio de Apostolis. And the
more intimately we know the Missal of St Augustine's Abbey, the more
reluctant shall we be to think that its owners had trilled with its text

l think, therefore, (i) that the use of the short illation as practised to
the present day in obedience to the direction of the authorized Roman
Missal is a use of extreme antiquity; (ii) that it was ¹St Gregory’s'
intention to supersede ·it at Easter and on feasts of Apostles by the
long illation, and (iii) that that intention is revealed to us by the Corpus
