cerned; and when we further consider that, if we except these three
instances, there is not from end to end of the Temporale a mass of,
Gregorian compilation in which a constituent once written can be found
to have been superseded by another; reason and justice alike counsel
us to pause, and to collect our thoughts before we charge the copyist
with haste or carelessness. And when we examine the constituents we
lind that caution such as this is more than justified. For the prayer
‘Mentes nostras,’ &c is of precisely the same length as the ‘Praesta
quaesumus,’ &c which it supersedes3 each of them, without its initial,
comprising 113 letters, or six lines of text; and we know that Gregory
himself made the very same sort of change in the Secreta sor Advent
Sunday, superseding 110 by 113, and again in those of the following
Friday and Saturday, when a total of 168 letters gave way to 166. Our
caution, l repeat, is more than justified¹.

Again, too, at the end of the second series, and at a place therefore
where, ii anywhere‚ there might be stichometrical reasons ior economy
of text, whether by expansion or by contractiori, the Secreta and Post·
communion appended in books like the Pamelian to the Oratio ‘Deus
qui tribus pueris,' &c have been marked for suppression bya reviser
whom we mus't in all faimess believe to have had irresistible authority
for what he did. But this sort of supersession is the very thing which
Gregory himself is proved to have practised, not by marginal hint but
in actual fact, and that under the coercion of a stichometrical necessity.
It was, l emphatically repeat, under the coercion of a stichometrical
necessity that on the F east of SS. F abian and Sebastian and on that of
St Laurence Gregory the Great has been proved to have made substi-
tutions such as these². ’

In the second place, we lind that the antiphonarial indication pre·
fixed to what is now the ferial mass for Wednesday, though written
secunda manu and written, therefore, as one may presume‚ with some
sort of authority, has been superseded by another; and that a like fate
has pursued that, written prima manu, for the F riday mass. But, when
we remember that, if only we except these two, there is not from end
to end of the volume an instance to be found in which the Antiphona
prefixed by the copyist to a Gregorian mass has been replaced or even
cancelled, we once more shrink from passing a hasty judgment on the
copyist ¹On the contrary, we feel it to be incumbent on us to look
