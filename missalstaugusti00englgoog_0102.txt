xc INTRODUCTION.

primitive portions of the Corpus MS. was different from that of the
adventitious; and accords with the theory that the textual purity of
the one group is referable to a short and direct pedigree from an auto
Gregorian original. My chief object, however, in the present chapter
has been to prove, not that the pedigree of the Corpus MS. is short, but
that the characteristics of the verbal text of what ex hypothesi is the
primitive portion ol the Proprium de Tempore of the Corpus MS. are
such as to justify us in saying that it exhibits a hitherto unsuspected
recension, and that that recension is such as it may well have received
at the hands of Gregory the Great himself. And if 1 may claim to have
attained that object, 1 may further claim to have found evidence cor·
roboratory of my thesis in the fact that the text of what is erlrypotlresi
the adventitious portion of the Proprium de Tempore is what we have
seen it to be

Supererogatory and needless though it might be in me to recapitu-
late and dwell upon the several characteristica which distinguish the
readings peculiar to the Corpus textos the Proprium de Tempore, Ι

may, nevertheless be permitted to remark that an accurate recollection
of those characteristica will be absolutely necessary to us in the task on
which we are now entering.

When dealing with the Proprium de Tempore we knew, with close
approximation to certainty, which of its masses were of Gregorian‚ which
of post-Gregorian, redaction; but the authors who helped us to that
knowledge are all but silent with regard to the Proprium Sanctorum.
Nor is the difficulty lessened by the circumstance that, whereas in the
Proprium de Tempore the adventitious masses lie either at the close of
certain groups, or, as on the Thursdays in Lent, at fixed intervals, they
are in the other Proprium intermingled with primitive work in obedience
to a chronological law of ruthless but exasperating impartiality¹.

Hence it is that 1 now take a different course from that followed in
the last chapter. I shall begin by making a list of the readings peculiar

¹ 1 need hardly say that, because this or that saint should bappen to have been aR0nuaa
martyr who suffered in the early ages of our era, it by no means follows that the Roman Churcb
had already assigned him liturgical honours by the time of Gregory the Great; for until
long after the death of Gregory many of the Roman saints who now figure ia our volume
lay half forgotten ia the labyrinthine passages of the catacombs.
