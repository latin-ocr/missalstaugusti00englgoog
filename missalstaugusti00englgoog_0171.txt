The verb in the latter clause of Ps. 9, ν. 19 is found under two
forms, ‘periet’ and ‘peribit' St Augustine seems to have employed
the former, though some copies of his Commentary on the Psalms have
‘patientia pauperum non peribit,’ and this is the reading of Pam, Rom.
and MS. (fol. 19). It is hardly to be supposed that St Gregory, idio-
matic reasons apart, would have preferred the awkward tribrach, even
had he found it in his manuscripts. Nor is there reason to believe
that he did so find it But what are we to say of our ‘perient' in a
quotation of the fourth verse of the same Psalm with ‘patientia pau·
perum non peribit'? It occurs at fol. 26 v. in the officium for the Third
Sunday in Lent. That St Jerome should have found and left it, is
credible enough, for he tells us that he had been indulgent to words
of the kind; that St Gregory should have borne with it for a series of
years, is credible enough; but it is far from likely that, with ‘peribit' in
constant use, he should have employed ‘peribunt' in two editions, only
to supersede it by ‘ perient’ in the third. I think, therefore, that ‘peri-
bunt' must be regarded as a post-redactional improvement of the text.
The like must be said of the competing ‘introite’ and ‘intrate' on
fol. 19v, and of ‘illuc' and ‘illic’ on fol. 28 v. That the better readings
were imported into Pam. and Rom. from the Vulgate is not a necessary
inference from their presence in the Vulgate. They were better and
more idiomatic forms3 but, being better and more idiomatic, are for
that reason more likely than their rivals to have been second on the
field.

So it is with the ‘susceptor meus es tu’ of Pam. and Rom, the rival
of our ‘susceptor meus es! lt was the more idiomatic and more
finished phrase, and is, besides, the less likely of the two to have been
the reading found by St Gregory in the Roman Psalter. St Jerome’s
two correspondents in the north of Europe observed that the ‘tu' in his
rendering of Ps. 93, ν. 11 had no support from their copy of the Greek‘.
This St Jerome acknowledged, but said that the ‘tu' had been put in
‘propter εὐφωνίαν] And similarly on the present passage in Ps. 90,
v. z. Their copy of the Greek, unlike those known to uS, gave
no support to ‘es,' still less-so it would seem—to ‘es tu'; it seems
to have read ἐρεῖ τῷ κυρίῳ ὀντιλήπτωρ μου rol καταφυγή μου.
Jerome's answer is ‘ego uobis amplius dicam quod apud Hebraeos
nec es habeat nec tu3 sed apud Septuaginta et apud Latinos pro
εὐφωνίᾳ et uerborum consequentia positum sit.' That is to say, the
Seventy had added εί, the Latini es; but he had gone further and
