My readers have no need that Ι should tell them the ‘significance ol
this result. ' That the textual content ol a leal os the prototypa ol the
mass-books brought to Canterburyby St Augustine and his lorty monlrs

should prove to have been the same as that os a leaf of the exemplar
of MS. e.c.c.c. 270, throws the onus probandi on those—ii, indeed, there
be any such—who are unable to persuade themselves that the books
described by¹ Archbishop Egbert as seen by him at St Augustine's in

the eighth century can have survived there till the close ol the eleventh.

The threegroups os changes which 1 shall presently examineare, lor
several reasons, even more interesting than the first. They elucidatc
the history of the prototype, they elench the prool ol the claim to the
characteristics ol 'consistent titulation and accurate transcription which 1
have lrom the ⁸first asserted lor so much ol the Corpus MS.· as represents
primitive work; and they put us in touch with a clue to the date ol the
Canterbury original. But first let us leam how it was that St Gregory's
pages were so ruled as to contain, on the average, rather more than
370 letters each

It is but reasonable to suppose that when St Gregory had so far
prosecuted those labours of his on the codex gelasianus which have been
described to us by his biographer¹ he would take care that the leaves ol
his new uolumen should be ol such a capacity, and the first mass ol his
proposed liber sacramentorum ol such a textual value, as to correspond
theone with the other. ll we speculare at all, we must speculate in
accordance with our knowledge ol the usage by which the prologue or'
first section ol a work was made, with its rubrics, to fill an integral page
