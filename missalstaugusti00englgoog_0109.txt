But when 1 tum to the ‘Moralia' 1 find the prae-Gregorian favourite
employed no less than eleven times in malam partem, but only thrice
conversely¹; and in one of the three instances it serves as the expressed

synonyme of ‘gratulari ’‚ whilst in another (xxxt. xxvi.) its employment
is evidently forced upon the writer by an urgent literary exigency, the
necessity of expounding the phrase ‘ gloria narium eius terror ’-‘ gloria
ergo narium eius terror est quia iustus inde gloriatur unde peccator
[poenae] addicitur...Quia igitur unde gloriatur iustus inde terretur
iniustus, dicatur recte gloria narium eius terror².’

Besides the festa thus sar enumerated, there is yet another, the
mass assigned to which has a claim, though not, perhaps, an in-
defeasible claim, to mention in this place, 1 mean that of SS. Cosmas
and Damian. For, since their basilica near the Roman forum was not
assigned to them until the pontificate of Felix IV. (ab. 526530), it
seems reasonable to attribute the silence of the Verona book to that
fact, and to regard our ‘tibi conciliet' at fol. 122, lin. 14, as St Gregory's
correction of a'conciliet' of his own previous adoption; as, in short, a
repetition of the amendment already found at fol. 14, lin. 5.

To these instances we must add our ‘digna conspectu' at fol. 99 v,
lin. 2, in place of ‘digna conspectui,' and our ‘qui uiuis' at fol. 100 v,
lin. 8, in place of ‘Per domiuum.¹

Before passing on to the next division of the present chapter l must
note a little detail of internal evidence too remarkable to be acci·
dental.

Not one of the instances just recorded occurs in the body of an
Oratio; and if we tum to the list culled from the Proprium de Tempore
we shall find a like phenomenon. Omitting the thirteenth instance, on
the ground that until the time of the redaction represented by the
Corpus MS. the ‘De Sancta Maria,’ being as yet only a votive mass,
had not found a place in the Proprium de Tempore, we find that of the
remaining eighty-three only six are marked as belonging to the proper
Oratio of a mass The second of them (no. 6) is an ablative-case clause.
of which hereafter, with its necessary 'per eundem' in the conclusion;
and the third (noar) an unimportant ‘plebi tuae propitius’ for ‘propitius
plebi tuae,’ which, after all,may have been no more than a rubricator's
disarrangement3 the first and fourth (nos. 2 and 60) are outside the
body of their respective prayers; whilst the fifth and sixth (nos. 77 and
