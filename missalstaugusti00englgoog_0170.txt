as we see, in the third. Perhaps, however, it is a mere irreption from
the Vulgate.

But, whatever be the number of true Gregorian variants in Class B,
be the genuine instances comprised in it two, three or four, they are in
the last degree unimportant. For we cannot say that in any ol them,
as in A 1, Aa, A 3, A 5, A7, A9, is either of the competing forms
more euphonious than the other; none of them, like A4, exhibits a
manifestly good in contrast with a manifestly bad reading3 in none os
them can we see marks ol a steadier grammatical purpose or apurer
idiomatic standard; in none of them suppose that either ol the com·
peting forms was suggested by the pressure of public calamity.

Let us now turn to Class D.

With the possible exception of ‘importunitatibus' (D 3), there is no
reason to think any of our readings in Class D other than genuine¹;
sor ‘irascetur’ (D 18) and ‘orationes' (D 19) are supported by many
mediaeval copies of the Psalter; ‘ut saluum lacias' (D 23) lor ‘ut
saluum me sacias’ is in analogy with the ‘ne repellas' ol all except, Ι
believe, the Cassiodorian reading of Ps 43, v. 23 (see D 5) and with
St Jerome's explicitly defended ‘inuocabo' ior ‘inuocabo te' at Ps. 114,
v. 2'; whilst ‘inimicos’ for ‘inimicos meos' (D 27) resernbles readings
oi Ps. 17, vv. 47, 48, and Ps. 18, v. 6 which we know to have come
under the cognizance of the great critic. Nor can Ι cast ‘Ierusalem
qui' (D 12) into the contemned limbo ol clerical errors, lor Berno ol
Reichenau, in the ‘De Varia Modulatione' already quoted, makes special
mention ol the masculine form 2-‘In illa lectione Super mentm excelsum
ascende quidam codices in masculino genere habent Qui mangelizas
Sion, et qui euangelicos Hierusalem, cum iuxta Hebraicum feminino
genere pronunciandum sit: Quae euangelicos Sion et quae euangelicos
Hierusalem ,· praecipiturque Sion et Hierusalem ut...dicant ciuitatibus
luda: Ecce Deus uerteret caetera quae sequuntur⁸.' And our very curious
‘non timebit' (D 8) lor ‘non timebis ’-‘ Scuto circumdabit te, ueritas
eius non timebit a timore nocturno '-has its analogue in the ‘Fiat
manus tua ut saluum me laciat' ol Cassiodorus in the ‘De Institutione

Diuinarum Litterarum‘ (cap. 15), lor in the ‘Expositio Psalterii' he
reads ‘ut saluum me iacias⁴.’
