³ When first I knew MS. c.c.C.c. 270 the leaves here numbered rdg and 163* were, to all
rance, firmly stuek together. But when in the summer of the 1ο lowing year-the year

iiiia-l spent a weelr or two over the book Inobserved· that the two membranes shewed a dia·
position to part company. 1 called Mr Lewrs's attention to the lact, and, the weather being

exceedingl hot and dry, begged permission os him to leave the volume open ior a night. On
coming to iis roorns next morning—July syth-1 iound the separation completed.

The present leat 163 and the present leai 165 were at one tinae cont' ons. But ra} lines oi
text being erased stom the verse oi the former and ra} lines from t erecto ο1 the latter. the
second text here printed in italics was written on the whole ο1 the first and part nithe second oi
these erasures. It comprised one Epistle, ‘Nolumus uos ignorare,’ &a and two Gospels; but we
must careiuily remark that, the Postcommunion which, with the Pretace, had disappeared in the
erasure was neither restored nor replaced by a substitute either on 16 u. oron 165. One would

This done, the uerso os the tpresent 163‘ was made to carry so much oithe first text aa hnd
been spared on 16311. and besi esthisa new Postcommunion. Then were written the Epiatle
and the two Gospels just mentioned; after them, on the latter hals ο1 164, a [asson and Goapel,
and atter these again the two Masses on 164 v.

The second text now bro ht to light on 163 u, with its proper sequel on 165 was written, 1
should say, by the middle-tue ithcentury hand that made the three marginal additions to ⁴5 v.
The recte of the inserted 163· is. ο1 course, blank. The writing on 163’ u. and on both sides ol
the other inserted teat, tot. 164, is all by a thimaeum-century hand.

The erased text on the verso ο1 1631111111011111100111111111Ἰ 01 the Preiace, besides the
rubrie and initial, nothing can be deeiphered but ‘per' and ‘de itionem ’ at the end, respec-
tively, ol its first and fifth lina, anda ‘g' near the beginning ο its seventh line. The Preiace
began on the ninth line of the ruling, and, presumably, a ‘Hanc i ‘tur' on the aeventeenth.

‘Posucoatuuuto' on its sixth line, ο1 an initial ‘O' on line 7, and oi‘pla' almost immediately
