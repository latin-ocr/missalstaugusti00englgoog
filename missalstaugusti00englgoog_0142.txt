remarkable modification which Pope Gregory made in his working copy
oi Redaction D; and that, until the work ol concealment was completed,
he allowed his sacramentades to remain undisturbed.

Be this detail as it may, Reductions A and B point to an accessible
chamber oi St Caecilia and an accessible papal crypt at the beginning
ol Gregory's pontificatc; the Corpus MS. reveals to us a prototype de·
liberately manipulated and modified in attestation ol a crypt and a
chamber closed, aud effectually closed, against approach. lt also gives
us one more prool oi the lact which more especially concems us at
the present moment, that the pages os the prototype were ol the same
textual capacity as those ol the exemplar oi the Corpus MS.

This latter fact is, obviously, ol importance. It proves that, lor any-
thing that can be seen to the contrary, the exemplar os the Corpus MS..
so sar from being a document foreign to the prototypo, may have been
either the very book which had undergone the manipulation 1 have just
described, or, is not the book itscll, one oi its derivatives, the libri
missales which Archbishop Egbert tells us that St Augustine brought
to Englaud. I shall discuss the alternative in my concluding chapter.

The mention ol Archbishop Egbert calls back to mind what he tells
us about the English observance os the summer ember·season; and the
occasion is all the more opportune, as it is in connexion with the sum-
mer ember·week that the Corpus MS. exhibits a group ol constituent
peculiarities which this is the proper moment lor describing.

The first thing that strikes us on examining the Corpus MS. is that
neither explicitly nor by implication was the group ol summer ember-
masses assigned, as first copied into it by the transcribet, to the second
week in June, the traditional place held by it in the time ol Amalarius¹
and presupposed‚ to all appearance, in the texts used by Minard and
Da Rocca, nor yet to Whitsun-week itselt', the place which the author
ol the Micrologus (cap. xxv) tells us had been given to it, first by St Leo,
and aster him by St Gregory'. As regards the latter pontifi, the testi·
mony ol the Micrologus is clear enough-‘Sanctus quoque Gregorius
papa primus, a quo omnia ecclesiastica officia pene habemus, beato
Leoni optime concordat, qui et in sacramentario et in diurnali Anti-
phonario eidem ieiunio nullas orationes uel cantus adscribit, nisi inira
Pentecosten dicendos! And yet the testimony ol Archbishop Egbert

is equally clear. According to him, the place given to the summer last
