INTRODUCTION. lvii

transcription to which allusion has just been made. I refer to our
‘commercia' as against ‘mysteria’ in the Secreta ‘Aecclesiae tuae
domine munera sanctifica, et concede ut per haec ueneranda commercia
pane caelesti refici mereamur, per! The like change of ‘mysteria’ into
‘commercia’ has been suggested, by a hand not as yet identified, in the
following prayer of the Verona book (lx),-‘ Exaudi nos Deus salutaris
noster, quia per haec sacrosancta mysteria (commercia) in totius ec·
clesiae confidimus corpore faciendum quod eius praecessit in capite?
One would suppose that, in one case as in the other, ‘commercia’ must
be the later, ‘mysteria’ the earlier, of the two readings; for ‘commercia'
is so appropriate in a Secreta which, like the present, embodies the idea
of a sacred transaction between worshippers and Worshipped as to make
it hard to believe that any one would think of dislodging it in favour of
a less suitable substitute like ‘mysteria' This idea of a sacred transac-
tion is developed and expressed with both brevity and clearness in
another of the Verona prayers (vm. xxiii.),-‘ Exercentes Domine
gloriosa commercia offerimus quae dedisti ut te ipsum mereamur
accipere. Per'; but with far less of theological accuracy and point than
in this of ours¹.

The ‘homo unigenitus refulsit deus' at fol. 11 v, lin. 18, and the
‘protomartyre' in the re-written Postcommunion on fol. 13, have, as
compared with ‘genitus' and ‘martyre' the same quality of superiority
which would seem to denote a painstaking recension. It may be well
to suggest that ‘unigenitus refulsit Deus' has the support of a well-
known variant of a passage in St John's Gospel (1. 18)-‘unigenitus
Deus qui est in sinu Patris?

Our Oratio in the mass ‘De Sancta Maria,’ at fol. 15, lin. 2, is-
‘Deus qui salutis aeternae beatae Mariae uirginitate faecunda humano
generi praemia praestitisti, praesta quaesumus ut' &c The alliteration
‘praemia praestitisti praesta' is very striking3 so, too, is the parallelism
of ‘praestitisti’ said of a blessing in the past and ‘praesta’ said of a
blessing in the future. l should be disinclined, therefore, to attribute
‘praesta' to an error in transcription; nor can l think the rival ‘tribue'
a clerical error, for it is the reading of all the texts hitherto printed. lf,

Compare also the ‘Grata tibi sint Domine munera’ and the ‘Conseruent nos quaesumus
Domine munera tua’ in the Secreta and Postcommunion, respectively, of one and thesaure Mass
in Menrud (uxxvrn. 192⁰, ¹93 Α).
