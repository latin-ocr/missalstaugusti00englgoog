peculiarities, however, are made to disappear (Ι still suppose Gregory to
have worked on the form presented by the Verona book) by the
substitution of ‘operatione sua' and ‘perficiant esse placitos' for ‘opera-
tiones suae' and ‘perficiant nos pacatos'

My own belief, then, is that ‘operatione sua perficiant esse placitos'
is a correction made by Gregory himself of ‘operationes suae perficiant
nos pacatos} and that—ill satisfied, after all, to let the ungainly ‘per-
ficiant' disfigure his page-he replaced it on a later review by the
reading in our text.

lt cannot, l think, be an occidental circumstance that all three
readings are of the same textual value, each of them comprising thirty·
live letters.

The imperfect construction ‘perficiant esse placitos’ would afford
sufficient reason for the change to the Canterbury form, for the absence
of ‘tibi’ was a grave defect. The equivalent measurement of our
reading and its very boldness give us a double presumption that the
change was made by Gregory himself ; for the utmost that any one but
he would have been likely to attempt would have been, I should suppose,
to smuggle in a harmless necessary ‘tibit’

lt may be objected that if the Corpus text has introduced a neces-
sary ‘tibi' it has also brought back a needless ‘nos’ 1 hope to give due
consideration to the factio a later chapter.

The sixth of our present group of instances occurs at fol. 3121,
lin. 17, in the Secreta for the Tuesday after Passion Sunday, the prae-
Gregorian form of which, as found in the Verona book (xvlll. xiii), is
singularly ungraceful—‘ Hostias tibi, Domine, deferimus immolandas, qui
temporali consolatione significas ut promissa non desperemus aeterna'

Now, nothing could be imagined more felicitous than the change found

in the Corpus MS, nothing more masterly than its conversion of ‘qui
temporali consolatione significas' into ‘quae temporalem consolationem
significant! The meaning is clear—We dedicate to thee this strengthen-
ing bread, this gladdening wine 3 they are the symbols of earthly conso-
lation; may we thus lay all the surer hold upon the heavenly joys laid
up in store for us. But it is hard to believe that the man who could
make so brilliant an emendation of so troublesome a text could not have

¹ It maybe that even this would be thought to require the express authority of prae-Gregorian
precedent by anyoue who might be inclined to make the change. The changed order of
D'Azevedo's ‘placitos esse perficiant' as well as his ‘tibi' would seem lo have been suggested
by the following Preface in the Verona book (xxix xviii.) :-‘ Vere dignum. Referentes gratias et
precantes ut, tibi nos placitos esse perficiens, quibus succurris indignis propitieris acceptis. Per?
