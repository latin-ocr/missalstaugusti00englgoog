and, singularly enough, this is the very thing which St Gregory-or, if
not he, his amanuensis—seems to have done. The rubric in the Corpus
MS, although reduced toa mere compendium in three letters—PRO.-

is, nevertheless, cut into two, the first letter being on 27 v. (5), the
second and third on 27 v. (6)¹; but, as the scribe of the Corpus MS. was
not a man of trumpery caprices, and as this is the only instance ol the
kind in the volume, l inser that there was a divided rubric in the
exemplar. It' this inserence os mine be a right inference‚ it yields us a
trustworthy proof oi the genuineness os the two readings ‘defende’ sor
‘nos deiende' and ‘mensae caelestis libatio' sor ‘mensa caelestis,’ as
also a morally certain corroborative proof that the exemplar was a
working copy; forthere is no reason to believe that the bisection os a
minor rubric would have been either attempted or allowed in a finished
duplicate. This, 1 repeat, is the only instance in the whole os the MS.
oi a bisected word in a minor rubric.

Again. Ats01.31v.,nn. 19, and in the Secreta sor the Tuesday in
Passionweek, the scribe oi the Corpus MS. omitted the final ‘pen' lt,
surely, cannot be a mere chance that in this very Secreta we encounter
one of the most important variants proper to that revision ol the verbal
text ol the Sacramentary² which is so strikingly attested by the Corpus
MS. The book, which has been the scene ol St Gregory‘s own manipula-
tion ol the passage, was the very book to lack so matter-oi-course an
adjunct, and to lack it as a consequence ol that manipulation.

Can these coincidences be fortuitous?

suntide masses as they stand displayed in the light of the theory os a
working copy, a theory kindled by the rays which those phenomena
themselves threw together into focus, and, turning the leaves os the
