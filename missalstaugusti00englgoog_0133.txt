INTRODUCTION. cxvll

consideration, Ι observe that, besides the eight changes just noted in the
first nine messes of the book, our Proprium de Tempore has but three
other instances ol divergence from the constituent text os Pamelius and
Muratori. They are the ‘Pro Populo' ior the Saturday after Ash-
Wednesday, and the Secreta and Postcommunion lor the Eighteenth
Sunday alter the octave oi Pentecost.

But, when Ι examine these eleven instances I find that in no fewer
than seven of them we agree with Mdnard and Da Rocca The accord·
ance, moreover‚ is absolute; the Christmas Preiace appearing in the
curtailed form found by those editors, not in the longer and, presumably,
original form proper to the Verona book (XL. viii). A coincidence so
striking would seem to discredit the theory that the manuscripts on
which Menard and Da Rocca worked exhibit a gratuitous and in·
explicable succession of spurious variations capriciously soisted into
genuine Gregorian work; and serves to confirm an opinion which Ι have
long entertained, that we have (A) in Menard and Da Rocca a first and
perhaps tentative coordination of constituents and (Β) in Pamelius and
Muratori a new arrangement. ’

The record os isolated instances yielded hythe Proprium Sanctorum
is very slight. We differ from Muratori and Pamelius once on the
Vigil of SS. Peter and Paul, and once on the Feast oi SS. Cornelius
and Cyprian; whilst our ,mass ior the Feast of St Caecilia differs from
Muratori and Pamelius in the Postcommunion.

There 333, however, three complex groups or systems of constituent
changes analogous to the two groups or systems just indicated in the
Proprium de Tempore ; and on these Ι shall have to dwell at the
proper moment When all shall have been examined, it will, l leel
assured, be evident that the Corpus MS, besides its claim to exhibit a
revision hitherto unsuspected ol the verbal text oi the Gregorian
Sacramentary, and a structural text peculiar to itsels, has established the
further claim of embodying a new assortment os constituent elements
indicative os a comparatively late recension.

Let us, then, by Redaction Α understand the redaction to which is
reserable so much as is authentic in the documents made known by
Menard and Da Rocca, and by Redaction B that to which must be
referred so much as is authentic in those made known to us by Pamelius
and Muratori. The parent 'oi the missals which underlie the Pio·
