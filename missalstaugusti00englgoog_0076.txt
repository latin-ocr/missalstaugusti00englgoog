lxiv INTRODUCTION.

that ‘libera seruitus' and ‘libera mente seruire’ were understood to be
the proper equivalents of an unqualified ‘famulatus’ and an unqualifred
‘famulari' Perhaps, therefore, it would be safe to say that, since ‘libera'
is the accompanying adjective of ‘mente' in the prayer ‘Protector
noster’ on fol. 23 v, the praeGregorian texts may have concluded with
‘semiamusss and that the unchallenged ‘famulemur' found in Menard,
Pamelius and other editors is an early substitution of St Gregory's for
‘seruiamus¹.'

Tuming, however, to the ‘Concede quaesumus' on fol 27 v, let us
enquire whether St Gregory, finding such a phrase as ‘ut...liberati...
seruiamus,' would have been likely to replace it by ‘ut...liberati...famu-
lemur! For the answer to this question l without further delay consult
the ‘Moralia'

Now, it is clear that, although the author of the ‘Moralia' can employ
both ‘seruus' and ‘famulus' (xxt. xiii.) in one and the same connexion,
he takes care to make ‘famulus' not ‘seruus' the correlative of ‘uerus
Dominus? Similarly, although he can call the devil himself (xxxm.
xiv.) the ‘seruus' and the ‘sempiternus seruus’ of God, he is mindful
not to style him the ‘famulus' of God. On the other hand, although
(vul. viii.) the elect are in this life subject to the ‘seruitus corruptionis,’
Gregory the Great takes care, and presumably for that very reason, to
call them not ‘serui’ but ‘famuli Dei’ and ‘filii Dei’2—‘nunc in Dei
filiis de libertate nihil ostenditur...tunc in Dei famulis de seruitute nihil
apparebit'

But, when we enquire into his use of ‘seruire' and ‘famulari' we find
in him none of that complacency for the former word which had been
displayed by the elder liturgists. He does, indeed, in one place (lx. xli.)
write ‘ex amore seruire,’ but only because (as it would seem) he hasa
grammatical justification for the phrase-‘ obsequia Deo non reddimus
si ex timore mandatis illius et non potius ex amore seminus: ‘ex
timore...et...ex amore seruire' being a happy zeugma for ‘ex timore
seruire...et...ex amore famulari.’ But, whilst he employs (xxxlu. v.)
‘inseruire’ and ‘familiarius obsequi' of the service of the wicked to a
wicked lord, and ‘familiarius seruire’ (xxxn1. i.) in a like sense, his
usual word for the homage of the good to the All-good is ‘famulari'
The reason of this would seem to be his resolve never to forget that the
true service of God is the service of a willing obedience and devotion.
