No sooner do we realize the fact that the mass in honour of St Leo
cannot have formed part of the primitive portion of the Corpus MS.
than we find a way of accounting for its genitive-case title Had it
been a primitive mass, it would, assuredly, have been headed ‘De
sancto Leone,' by reason of the concurrence of the anniversary with the
Vigil of SS. Peter and Paul.

At fol. 93 u, lin. 14, we encounter a most reprehensible ‘facta sectari,’
the exclusive property of the Corpus MS. in its reading of a prayer
found in the Verona book (xx. vi). The fact that the prayer is an
Oratio raises a presumption that the mass in which it occurs, for SS.
Primus and Felician, is adventitious. What, then, do we find upon
examinationi We find nothing save this in the Malmesbury record
(under ‘Quartodecima Porta ') :-‘ In eodem monte [Celio]...reconditi
sunt martyres Primus et Felicianus’ ‘Recondere,’ Ι need not say,
means ‘to reconsign' or ‘to bury over again’; audon turning to

the Liber Pontificalis(§ 128) Ι find, under the pontificate of Theodore
(an, 642-649), the following record :-‘ Eodem tempore releuata
sunt corpora sanctorum martyrum Primi et Feliciani, quae erant in
arenario sepulta uia Nomentana, et adducta sunt in urbem Romam.
Quae et recondita sunt in basilica beati Stephani protomartyris'

The prayer ‘Praesta q. o. d. utqui beati...martyris tui [martyrum
tuorum] natalitia colimus a cunctis malis imminentibus eius [eorum]
intercessione liberemur,’ occurs six times in the course of the Proprium
Sanctorum3 on one of the six occasions, however, the iirst word is not
‘Praesta’ but ‘Concede' This is an unimportant variant; but not so
the remarkable ‘adiuuemur' instead of ‘liberemur' on two of the six
occasions, the Feast of SS. Alexander Eventius and Theodulus (fol. 88)
and the second of the masses in honour of St John the Baptist (fol. 96).
As the Corpus MS. has the support of D’Azevedo in the latter instance,
1 can only place the former on my list ; but, as the first of the two
midsommer-day masses is post-Gregorian,a presumption is thus raised
against the authenticity of the mass on fol. 88, the other of the two
testing-places of the more rare verb. On St John’s Day the Corpus
MS, as also D'Azevedo’s, reads not ‘intercessione' but ‘intercessionibus’

time out of date (for three successore had died meanwhile), Pope Sergius resolved to tmusform it
with as little disturbence of text as might be into a festive mass for leo the Great. Nothing
could be simpler then to substitute for it ‘Annus dne ut intercessione beati honis haec nobis
prosit,’ &c- We only need further suppose (3) that a scribe, mbled by the similarity of the two
compositions, omitted to make the necesmy alteration, and all wonder vanisbes

ln a word, ibelieve the anomalous Secreta to be u survival from the mortuam mass
