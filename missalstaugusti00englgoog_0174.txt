his antiphonaries exhibited as compared with others, a corresponding
contrast in, at least, that portion ot' it which was concemed with the
‘plena hebdomada post pentecosten! Il this was indeed the case, we
may with some confidence aver that the interpolating rubricator who
wrote the titles ol the officia which were to supersede the ellaced
Prefaces did not take them from an undeveloped copy of the Anti·
phonary. The reason lor thinking this is, that he prepared a title, or
capitulum, for the new officium ‘Sperent in te' And the account Ι
would give ol the ‘Sperent in te' is, that it bears the same relation to
the volume or volumes which contained it, as do the new set of Advent
masses and the new set ot' summer ember-masses to Subredaction D‘ of
the Sacramentary.

But, il it be true that the addition of the officium ‘Sperent in te’
to one or more oi those copies oi the third redaction of the Anti-
phonary which Augustine was to carry with him from the Coelian Hill
synchronized, or nearly synchronized, with his master's manipulation
ol the Missal; when had those changes ol constituent and verbal text
been made which differentiated the third redaction from its prede-
cessor? Did the third and as yet unenlarged edition of the Antiphonary
precede or follow the fourth and as yet unmodified edition ol the
Sacramentary?

' With but one exception, the opening syllables ol each officim trans·
serred into our volume correspond with the antiphonarial indication
which had been already copied, as a sort of subtitle‚ from the exemplar.
The exception occurs on the Eleventh Sunday alter the Octave ol
Pentecost, when we find ‘Deus qui in[·habitare facit]’ as the anti-
phonarial indication, but ‘Deus qui habitare lacit' in the officium. But
our reading in the ffcium (see D 33) differs from that in Pam. and
Rom, which is in its turn that of the indication. This would seem to
prove that when the execution of the Canterbury original was under·
taken the first, and possibly the second, redaction of the Antiphonary was
in use, but not as yet the third That the first rather than the second
redaction supplied the indications is shewn to be highly likely by the
lact, that, although our indications lor the Ember Friday in Advent,
ior the F irst Sunday in Lent and lor the Monday in Passionweek agree
with the Pamelian antiphonary, they differ lrorn the Pio-Clementine
gradual, being ‘Prope esto Domine' not ‘Prope estu Domine'3‘1n-
uocauit me¹,' &c not ‘Inuocabit me,' &c; ‘Miserere mihi Domine,' not
