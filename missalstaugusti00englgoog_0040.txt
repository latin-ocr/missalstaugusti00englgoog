But, indeed, the absence oi such a word as ‘beati' ‘sancti’ or ‘martyris’
is not the sole characteristic ol the Liberian record; lor, unless the
phraseology ol the writer was peculiar to himself, the very expression
‘quae appellatur Valentini' would seem to prove that Valentine, whoever
he may have been, and whatever his history, was not the patronal saint
os the basilica. Thus, one os the documents used sor the compilation ol
the Liber Pontificalis [5 17] speaks ol a ‘coemeterium quod appellatur
in hodiernum diem coemeterium calixti: the cemetery being one with
whose construction a Calixtus had while still living had some prominent
concern ; and a second [5 34] tells us that Pope Silvester, the immediate
precursor ol Julius, built a church ‘quam titulum Romanum constituit...
qui usque in hodiernum diem appellatur titulus Equitii: Equitius having
been the name oi the owner ol the site on which he built it But, so lar
as 1 am aware, the words ‘appellatur’ and ‘dicitur‘ are never to be iound
in connexion with the patronal name os a church or catacomh.

And inapproaching the ageos Gregory the Great himself, we consult
the Monza papyri, which comprisc the names, not merely ol saints
honoured with asestum, but oi saints at whose shrines lamps were burst,
we lind no Valentine.

Or is we turn to the Martyrologium Hieronymianum and look lor
the name under date ol xvi. Kal. Mar. and in connexion with the
F laminian Way, we look in vain ¹.

The first known mention oi the Roman St Valentine occurs in
a seventhcentury document, the elder ol the so-called Salzburg

would seem to be just the sort oi hook that a Christian ol wealth and influence might have
presented to some philanthropic pagan who, encouraged hythe example oi Constantine, had
played the part oi patron to the adherente ot' a theology which as yet he hesitated to embrace‚ hy
giving them land on which to build a church; ior it bears a frontispiece eaecuted by none other
than Furius Dionysius F iloealus, the great architect whose name is imperishsbly associated with
that oi Pope Damasus in the reconstmction and edomarent ol the cataoombs, and who was to

him what Bramante and Michael Angelo were to be to later pontifis, and adorned with the ·

following legenda—‘Valentinis lloress in Deo‚’ ‘Valentine lege feliciter: ‘Valentine uiuas tloreas,’
‘valentine uiues gaudeas'

But this is not all. Α most remarkable coincidence, hitherto unnoticed‚ as l believe, is this,
that the subject ol the drawing thus expressly executed in eompliment to Valentinus represents a
curtained archway. li it be no extravagance ot lancy to see in this the doorvay or, more
probably, the baldachino ol a church, 1 would suggest that Furius Dionysius Filoealus was the
architect oi the ‘basilica Valentinh’ that he had been employed by Valentine in its erection, and
that the kalendar was adorned by him in compliment to hia patron either Μὴν motu or at the
instance oi Pope Julius.
