As to the ‘Cuius hodie laciem' (sol. lov.) and the ‘Quia nostn'
saluatoris' (iol. 12), we have already seen that they are two members ot'
an interesting group ol constituent changes effected in the Sacramentary
alter the Sacramentary had been finally committed to parchment. The
analogy to that group ol changes exhibited by several others, and the
marvellous agreement oi them all in bearing the severest stichometrical
test which could be applied to them, leave it past all doubt that the
'⁴ Cuius hodie faciem' and the ‘Quia nostri saluatoris’ owe it to no

· When dealing with the antiphonarial excerpts we found reason for
the opinion that the indications which in very many oi our masses stand
between the capitulum and the first rubric were taken from the earliest
ascertained edition os the Antiphonary.

But we also saw that the second and third editions exhibit readings
οἱ the text ol the Psalter different t'rom those os the first; and that the
third exhibits readings different from those common to the first and
second. ¹

And Ι lind a like phenomenon in a fasciculus appended to our
Missal‚ a little document as to the authenticity os whose several details
there cannot be a doubt². Comprising in its subject-matter three-
