in its turn, like that ol the eve begins with ‘Te quidem omni tempore'
On each occasion, therefore, we have a salse grammatical construction;
there being nothing to couple the ‘agere’ ol the exordium with the
‘collaudare et praedicare' ο1 the one sequel, or with the ‘praedicare' ol
the other.

Now, it is quite possible (i) that the earlier reading in each case had
at one time been ‘Teque omni quidem tempore,' and (ii) that in each the
intention had subsequently been to turn this into ‘Et te quidem omni
tempore,' but (iii) that only hall ο1 the intention was carried out, scribe
and rubricator between them combining to produce ‘Te’ in place ol ‘Et
te,' just as at fol. 26 v, lin. 14, ‘Cunctis' was made to stand instead ο1
‘A cunctis? All this 1 say is theoretically possible.

Further: it is conceivable that (iv) the scribes ο1 the redaction
published by Pamelius and Muratori, finding themselves confronted by
an ungrammatical phrase, simply cut it short, thus offering up an awlul
sacrifice to syntax, and making the celebrant say alter his ‘Gratias
agamus Domino Deo nostro' and the response ‘Dignum et iustum est,'
not ‘Vere dignum et iustum est aequum et salutare nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere...Et te omni quidem tempore' dre, but ‘Vere
dignum et iustum est aequum et salutare te quidem domine omni
tempore’ or ‘te quidem omni tempore’ dte, the ‘gratias agere’ which
is the proper subject ol the sentence thus being unceremoniously
hustled out ol ic

But 1 do not think that thoughtlul minds would on careful reflec-
tion accept all this as probable. There is a lack ο1 simplicity in the
account which tells against it, and it attributes a degree ο1 pecca·
bility to the scribes which cannot be proved against them; lor,
obviously, it would be a mere begging oi the question to say that
they have sinned the like double sin in the case ο1 the prelace ‘De
Apostolis,' a first group omitting the copulative conjunction and a
second coming alter to curtail the lllation. Can there be no other
way os explaining the very briel lllation and the corresponding ab·
sence ο1 the conjunction at the opening ο1 the Prelace at Easter and
on feasts of Apostles?

lt is obvious to remember that there was a time when Rome had

only one anniversary ‘De Apostolis'; and this lact, in its turn,
invites the reflection that ol the great Dominical anniversaries Easter
is the oldest Can it be that in the brief lllation ‘Vere dignum et
iustum est aequum et salutare' we have the original sorm ol the com·
position, and that the long ‘Vere dignum....aeterne Deus' is a develop-
