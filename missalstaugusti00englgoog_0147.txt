of the galleries adjacent to the papal crypt and the sepulchral chamber

of St Caecilia, we may set down the date of that event as a termim a

quo for the date of the primitive and parent source of the Corpus MS.
And if l be right in assuming the obstruction to have been provoked

by fear of sacrilege at anticatholic hands, the occasion and the date are .

not far to seelr, for it was in the spring of 595 that news of the
approach of Agilulf and his Lombard hosts fell on the terrified ears of
Gregory the Great But, inasrnuch as the galleries and staircases of the
cemetery of St Calixtus must already have been earthed up before the
catastrophe occurred, we shall perhaps be safe in saying that Re·
daction D was completed by the spring of 594, and that the summer
of that year witnessed the threefold modification of the constituent text
01 the Proprium Sanctorum which we discussed in the last chapter.

To the year 595, 00 the other hand, or to the earlier half of 596 may
reasonably be ascribed the final readjustment of the liber missalis which
in the July of the latter year the Provost of St Andrew's carried with
him when he set forth on his memorable mission. By the final re·
adjustment l, of course, mean that to which is referable the new
assortment of constituents for the plena hebdomada postpentecostera

The changes in verbal text which are characteristic of Redaction D
must be assigned, for the most part, to the year 594, but I think that
there are one or two which must be referred to the year of the missi0n1.

The first startling fact which, now some few years ago, confronted and
for a moment appalled me in my examination of the rubrics of the
Proprium Sanctorum was the amative-case title of the mass of a saint
whose cultus I knew to have been more ancient than the age 01 St
Gregory. lt soon became evident to me that, unless the Corpus mass
01 81 Caecilia was adventitious to the primitive book whose contents 1
believed to 110 enshrined in the Corpus MS, the unique and splendid
pretension 01 the document would certainly be vitiated and, not im·
probably, rendered impossible 01 substantiation; and hence 1 felt it
right to say, when¹ searching for a terminus ad quem, that we should
have to confront another problem, that 01 a terminus a quo, and to
warn my readers that it would behove us to enquire whether the
primitive book revealed to us by the Corpus MS. yielded evidence 01 a
date so late in the pontificare 01 Gregory as that the sepulchral chamber
01 81 Caecilia had already been closed, her sertum suspended, and her

mass cancelled, before that primitive book left Rome for Canterbury.

¹ These will be noticed in a later chapter.
