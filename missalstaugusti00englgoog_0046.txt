spot is mentioned]: et Quintus et Quartus martyres iuxta ecclesiae in
cubiculo pausant [here a chamher in the church is specified]: et longe
in antro Trofimns martyr [here we have a cave or ambulacrum presumably
accessible to visitors]. Deinde peruenies eadem uia ad speluncam [here we
have an accessible subterranean chamber]: hic requiescit...[0bviously some
word is wanting here]: eadem uia sancta Eugenia uirgo et martyr in
cubiculo ecclesiae pausat [here we have a chamber in the church] et in
altero loco Emisseus martyr [here a specilic place]¹ Postea peruenies Via
Appia ad sanctum Sebastianum martyrem cuius corpus iacet in interiori loco
[implying that the body os St Sebastian was accessible, though the visitor
may not have seen the spot], et ibi sunt sepulcra [evidently visible] aposto
lorum Petri et Pauli...et...per gradus discendis ubi sanctus Cyrinus...
pausat [a place to go and see]. Et eadem uia ad aquilonem ad sanctos
martyres Tiburtium et Valerianum et Maximum [ie. to the church called
alter thern] 3 ihi intrabis ad speluncam magnam [agaim a place to go and
see]‚ et ibi inuenies Urbanum...et in altero loco Felicissimum et Aga·
pitumz...Et in tertia ecclesia rursum (isursum) sanctus Synon martyr
quiescit [the body being, as it would seem, in the church} Eadem uia

Dionisius..Julianus...Flauianus...sancta Cecilia...r.xxx. martyres ibi re·

quiescit'

lt is, 1 think, evident that Sixtus, Dionysius, Julian, Flavian, Caecilia
and the eighty are mentioned in very different terms srorn the other
saints and martyrs in the catalogue. They are not described as testing
‘in ecclesia,’ ‘in cubiculo ecclesiae,' or ‘in antr0,' or even ‘in inferiori
loco'; and no such phrase is employed as ‘peruenies,' ‘inuenies' ‘per
gradus descendes,' or ‘introibis in speluncam! They are simply said
to be testing ‘deorsum' a phrase which by contrast with the others may

reasonably be regarded as implying that they were known, or believed,
to be somewhere underground, but that their testing-places had been
concealed srorn view. The account proceeds :-

‘Cornelius...longe in antro quiescit. Postea peruenies ad sanctam
uirginem Soterem et martyrem. Eadem uia...Postea ad sanctum Dama-
sum...Deinde discendis per gradus ad sanctos martyres Nereum et
Achilleum, et sic uadis ad occidentem et inuenies sanctum Felicem episco-
pum et martyrem, et discendis per gradus ad corpus eius, dac, &c.¹

possibly, knew that ‘sixti‘ was right and ‘seu Praetextati' wrong, struck out the offending
words but omitted to striks out the justificatory clause that followed them.
