theory of an ¹exceedingly compendious abbreviation. But, in either
case, the most crucial of questions here emerges: Of all possible
places sor them, can it be that, in providential anticipation oi my
theory, the words ‘qui tecum uiuit‚' or a portion oi them, fell not only
at the extreme end os a page but, as the necessity oi the theory re·
quires, at the extreme end of a recto page? I hope to answer this
question presently.

2. Resuming the investigation,I find nothing worthy'o's present
mention till we come to the end os the fifth line ol fol. 10, where, for ‘qui
uiuis‚’ we have the relative pronoun, indeed, but the relative pronoun
followed by ‘uiu' with a horizontal stroke over the third letter. This
unparalleled way of writing the word seems to shew that the transcriber
knew not what to write; and the view l take of his ‘mark ol inde·
cision' seems to have been that taken by the reviser, who has been
careiul, using catchmarks as in the previous case, to write ‘qui uiuis' in
the adjacent margin. I think, then, that (i) either. the words had not
been written in full in the exemplar, or else, as before, that (ii) they
were not easy of decipherment, and that the reviser's object in making
note of them was to communicate to others a piece of knowledge as to
which he had no doubt. The latter alternative invites the further
inference that another recto page came to an end at this place, and thus
at the distance os forty lines os some eighteen or nineteen letters each
from the conclusion oi the prayer ‘Indignos nos.' Hence the theory
that the pages oi the document which ‘served as exemplar lor the
Corpus MS. were unicolumnar, and that each page held twenty such
lines as 1 have described. Let us now test the theory.

ΙΙ. counting-back from the end of ‘acceleret·qui uiuis' at lol. 10,
lin. 5 to the beginning os ‘Praesta q. o. d.' at fol. ov, lin. 6, we have the
transcriptos sorty such lines; counting back again from the end ol
fol. 9v., lin. 5, to the end ol ‘munere' at sol. 9, lin. 5, another like
quantity3 counting back once more to the junction ol the first and
second syllables ol ‘uenturae' at iol. 8v, lin. 15, the equivalent of

twenty. If, then,I am right, the broken phrase ‘Praesta qs οιῐΤρ ds ut
redemptionis nostrae uen-' filled the last two lines os some multiple os
twenty from the beginning os the exemplar. Can this have been the
case?

Carefully as the first three masses of the Corpus book have been
erased, traces of them remain which enable us to determine how much
os them was primitive, and how much adventitious. The first mass
contained a Preface in (isi-p) 12} lines, the second and third
