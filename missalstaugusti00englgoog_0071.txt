‘Sacris reparati mysteriis suppliciter exoramus ut...apprehendamus Q

effectu quod celebramus affectu'3 but some manipulator of the text has
inserted the word ‘rebus’ in explanation of ‘effectu’ and substituted
‘actionibus' for ‘affectu’3 thus cancelling a false antithesis, and bringing
the prayer into conformity with the ‘Sit nobis’ mentioned just now,

Moreover, our own book, at fol. 9, lin. 12, substitutes ‘effectum' for
‘affectum’ in the prae-Gregorian Secreta (Verona, XL111.iii.), ‘Praesta
Domine quaesumus ut...nostrae deuotionis offeramus allectum’3 thus
giving us no uncertain hint that with St Gregory himself the proper
meaning of ‘ effectus' was reality, realization, and the like ¹.

Proper, then, as it would be to ask that we may realize a glory of
which we have just received a pledge, the phrase ‘capiamus effectum’ is
unsuitable if employed notos glory, but of grace; for the grace we
have bears to the grace we crave the relation of earnest to increase, not
the relation of pledge to realiw.

lf this be so, it would seem to follow that the only way in which
the form hitherto current of this Postcommunion can be made to yield
a satisfactory sense, is to suppose ‘effectus’ to mean, not, as in the
Verona book and in the estimate of Gregory and his contemporaries it
seems to have meant, realization or intimate fact, but fulness or increase.
And this is, precisely, the meaning imported into the prayer by the
Corpus reading, ‘augmentum'

The instance of inverted verbal order at fol. 23, lin. 8 calls for no
notice in this place.

At fol. 25, lin. 8 we read ‘Hostias d. quas tibi offerimus propitius
suscipe’; but other editions have ‘respice’ instead of the true correlative
of ‘offerimus' In other places, however, as on the feasts of St Agnes
and St Laurence, they have ‘suscipe'3 and 1 suspect that all that can
here be claimed for our buok is the negative creditos a correct reading
as against a clerical error in the MSS. hitherto published, or their
prototype. The error may perhaps be referable to the ‘propitius
respice' of the prayer immediately preceding.

The like must be said of our ‘A cunctis nos d. reatibus...absolue' at
fol. 26 aa, lin. 14, as against the very remarkable ‘Cunctis' &c of other
editions. But the culprit in this instance was not, Ι should suppose,a
scribe, but a rubricator ; the rubricator, perhaps, of the prae-Gregorian
repertory known to us through the Verona manuscript, perhaps of an

excerpt from it, perhaps of Pope Gregory's own earlier working copies of
the sacramentary.
