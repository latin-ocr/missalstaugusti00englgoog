1111nooucr1on. xiii

unigenitum tuum sancti spiritus obumbratione concepit et uirginitatis
gloria permanente huic mundo lumen aeternum effudit' &c The words
. ‘Quae et unigenitum...aeternum effudit' are by, l believe, universal
consent attributed to Urban ΙΙ., who improvised them late in 1094 or
early in 1095, when about to open the Council of Piacenza 1 infer,
therefore, that the present volume, even if begun as early as the spring
of 1094, cannot have been finished before the summer of 1095.

1 believe that ordinarily it is not easy to find a closely approximate
termium ad quem for the date of an undated manuscript; nor is ours an
exception to the rule The character, however, of the script forbids us
to travel far into the twelfth century; and when we find at fol. 173 v. a
mass for king, queen and people we may feel morally certain that the
queen is the first consort of Henry 1. The terminus ad quem would
thus range from 1100 to 1118, with a preference for the earlier half of
the period. Now, the mass is certainly supplementary to the missal;
and 1 do not think that the handwriting, which is somewbat smaller and
bolder than that of the rest of the volume, can fairly be regarded as
other than that of a new scribe. The vermilion, too, of the rubrics is of
a brighter tint than the rest. It may perhaps be worthy of remark,
moreover, that in none of the prayers is there any mention of a proles
regia. These considerations would seem to justify us in assigning the
mass to a date slightly later than the coronation and first marriage of
Henry 1, and to place our terminus ad quem in the summer of 1100.

Assuming, then, for a moment that the missal was out of the hands
of the scribe in or before the summer of the year 1100, let us turn to
fol. 47. We there find that, the scribe having provided for the recita·
tion on Easter-Monday of the Prelace, the ‘Communicantes' and the

‘Hanc igitur’ of the previous day, his assignment of the second and
third of these constituents was noted and, as it would seem, adversely

called into question by one of whom 1 shall have occasion to speak
again as ‘the reviser.’ This reviser wields the pen, for the most part,
with authority, as though he were one whose nilnl obstat had been
solicited before the book should be used at the altar of St Augustine’s.
Nevcrtheless, instead of suppressing a manifestly intrusive line of text
and rubrio, he timorously places a note in the margin,-‘ Hac die non
dicimus communicantes nec hanc igitur! Surely the person for whose
information this was written was not one of themselves, but a stranger,
orat least one who, if not a stranger, though amongst them was not of

them3 else why the first person plural? Surely he was the prospective
owner of the book; else why such a memorandum in such a place?
