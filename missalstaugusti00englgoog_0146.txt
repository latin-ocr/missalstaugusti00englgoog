cxxx INTRODUCTION.

will remain unshaken; thatin this case, as in others, St Gregory's newer
arrangement was effected bya minute adjustment of materials3 his object
being to avoid all trace oi the mechanical device of intromitted leaves
of writing uniform with the rest of the volume, by taking care, as a
conditae sine qua non to success, that the nett aggregate value of the
added writing should be that of an even number of pages of twenty lines,
each line containing, as an average, some eighteen or nineteen letters

And here Ι would beg leave to record once more our obligation to
the vigilant care oi the principal reviser oi our volume But ior that
vigilant care at iol. 9v. and iol. 10, we should not have touched the clue
which conducted us to the reconstruction oi the opening pages of the
exemplar1. But for the like vigilant care of the reviser’s in cancelling the
Secreta at fol. 5 7, lin. 16, we should have been thwarted and embarrassed
at the outset of the proof that the Corpus MS. embodies an authentic
revision oi the verbal text of St Gregory's great liturgical monument'.
And, but for that suppression, but for the concomitant record of the
replacing Secreta, and but lora like double correction in regard of the
neighbouring Postcommunion, it would have been impossible to prove—
at any rate, to prove satisfactorily-that the very remarkable provision
for the summer ember·masses mentioned by Egbert of York as charac-
teristic of the missals seen by him at St Augustine's was a provision in
such wise peculiar to the missals of that monastery as that there may
have been no other and independent instance of it to be found in
Christendom.

The archetype of the Canterbury missals was, as it would seem, the
outcome of a fourth redaction; and, assuredly‚ if St Gregory when
engaged in its elaboration had already resolved to suspend the distinct
and separate celebration of the three serta discussed in our last chapter,
he would have taken care to do so before once again putting forth the
Sacramentary. On the other hand, we cannot suppose that, the fourth
edition once published, he would have undertaken so elaborate and
painstaking a triad of manipulations, but for the occurrence of some
event sufficiently grave to justify him in withdrawing those serta from
the time-wom observantes of the Roman Church.

If, then, we attribute this threefold suppression to a recent closing
