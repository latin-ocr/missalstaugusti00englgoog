fore to be added to the list of survivors by claim to survival,-1o. ‘Et te
in ueneratione,' &c (fol. 111v.), 11. ‘Qui aecclesiam tuam‚' &c (fol.
137 a), and 12. the ‘Quia cum ubique sis,’ &c appointed (at fol. 138)
to be used on the anniversary of the consecration of a church.

Six of the twelve are in the well-known list drawn up by Pope
Pelagius ΙΙ., and another was instituted by Pope Urban Il. lf it could
be proved that the mass ⁴ In dedicatione aecclesiae' is adventitious‚ we
might plausibly explain the escape of the Preface to the accident of
its not meeting tbe eye of the corrector as he passed frorn the Proprium
to the Commune in the exemplar; but if the mass be primary it would,
1 think, be safer to conclude that the Preface is authentic.

Making allowance, then, for this doubtful exception, we find that
four remain as claimants on our regard; namely, those numbered 1, 3,
6 and 11 in the soregoing lists.

The last of them is mentioned by Honorius of Autun in the fol·
lowing passage of the ‘Gemma Animae':-‘ Pelagius papa nouem
praefationes cantari statuit, scilicet ‘Quia per incarnati' de natiuitate,
‘Quia curn unigenitus' de epiphania, ‘Qui corporali ieiunio' de quadra·
gesima, ‘Qui salutem humani generis' de passione Domini uel de
sancta cruce, ‘Te quidem Domine omni tempore' de pascha, ‘Qui post
resurrectionem’ de ascensione, ‘Qui ascendens super omnes coelos’ de
pentecoste, ‘Qui cum unigenito filio,' de Trinitate, ‘Te Domine sup-
pliciter exorare' de Petro et Paulo, quae etiam de pluribus apostolis
dicitur. Gregorius uero papa decimam ‘Qui ecclesiam tuam' de sancto
Andrea adiecit quae de uno quolibet apostolo usquequaque dici con·
sueuit Noviter autem Urbanus secundus papa undecimam de sancta
Maria addidisse non ignoratur, quae a pluribus ubique frequentatur².' .
It cannot, surely, be an accidental coincidence that the ‘ Qui aecclesiam
tuam,' first found under a slightly different, and evidently earlier, form
in the Verona MS, and found there in honour of St Andrew‚ should
be the very Preface‚ and the only Preface‚ which the monks of St
Augustine’s took care to cause to be introduced into their mass for one
Apostle3 and the procedure is all the more remarkable because they
cancelled another Preface to make way for it lt would seem as ifa
custom which in other places had died out for lack of written authenti-
cation from Rome had survived among the sons of St Augustine at
Canterbury in virtue of the authority of St Gregory himself as declared

in the pages of that later redaction of the Sacramentary which he had
placed in the hands of the founder of their society. '
