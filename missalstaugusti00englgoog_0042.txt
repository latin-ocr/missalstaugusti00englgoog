xxx INTRODUCTION.

no possibility ol sestal celebration at the tomb ol St Caecilia in the
closing years ol the sixth century, or (ι) that there is a clerical error in
the titulation. Let us try the lormer ol these altematives.

The compilet ol the Acta ol St Caecilia tells us that she was a
Roman, against the evidence of Venantius Fortunatus¹, wh0, writing in
the sixth century, declared her to have been a Sicilian. He tells us
that she was buried in the cemetery ol St Sixtus, although the author
oi the lost Passio ol the saint would seem to have said that she was
buried in that ol Praetextatus3 and, when he adds that she was laid to
rest lying on her side and enclosed in a coffin ol cedar-wood, he makes
two statements ol extreme unlikelihood. But this is lar from all. The
narrative is matred by chronological impossibilities so flagrant as to
evacuate its claim to be regarded as an authentic history'. The Acta
may, 1 think, be plausibly regarded as an academical exercise written
aster the discovery ol the saint’s body by Pope Paschal 1, and derived,
partly from the pages ol the Passio, partly from the writer's experi-
ences as an eye-witness, and partly from his interior consciousncss.

The conspicuous place occupied by St Caecilia in the Verona book,
and the allusion to St Valerian and his alleged relation to her made
by one os the Prelaces in her honour which are comprised in that
collection, need, I think, leave no doubt that the body os the saint was
in the possessiones the Roman Church in the latter hall ol the fifth
century and that the Passio had by that time already been written.
But what next?

Il l at once formulate a theory ol my own, my apology lor doing so
must be that it has not been formed at haphazard.

Premising that the Commendatore Giovanni Battista de Rossi and
his brother the Cavaliere Michele Stelano de Rossi have made it
abundantly clear that the approaches to the chamber in which the body
ol St Caecilia was found by Paschal l. had at some time been carelully
blocked, presumably as a protection against the impiety ol barbarian
invaders, l venture to give it as my opinion that the body ol St Caecilia
was at a comparatively early date deposited in the cemetery oi SS.
Tiburtius and Valerian, a convertible term sor the coemeterium S.
Praetatati, which lay to the north ol the Appian Way; that, enclosed
in a coffin oi cedar-wood, it was at some later date carried to the cemetery
