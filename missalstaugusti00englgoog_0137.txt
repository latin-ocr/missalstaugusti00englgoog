I now come to the three groups of changes in constituent text¹ of
which 1 spoke just now' as peculiar to the Proprium Sanctorum of the
Corpus MS.

First: Redactions A and B had on the twentieth of January ex·
hibited two masses; one of which, in honour of St Fabian, comprised
the constituents ‘Infirmitatem nostram,’ duc, ‘Hostias tibi,' &c and
‘Repleti participatione: διας whilst the other, which contained the
prayers, ‘Deus qui beatum,' ac, ‘Accepta sit’ &c and ‘Sacro munere
satiati,' dte, did duty for St Sebastian. But the Corpus MS. gives
the two saints one mass, eomposed of the ‘Infirmitatem’ the ‘Ac-
cepta sit' and the ‘Sacro munere satiati'; its title and the verbal
text of its constituents being such as to suit the new and dual as·
signation.

Secondly: Redactions A and B had on the sixth of August exhibited
two masses in honour, the one of St Sixtus, the other of SS. Felieissimus
and Agapitus. The first of these is all that appears in the Corpus MS,
and it appears with modifications of title and of text which prove the
absence of the other to be not accidental.

Thirdly: Redactions A and Β had on the twenty-second of November
exhibited a mass in honour of St Caecilia. The reasons for believing
the mass in the Corpus MS. to have had no place in the Canterbury
original need not be repeated in this place⁸.

Now, let us assume, what l hope presently to prove, that these
changes were not made before or during the elaboration of Redaction D.
It is evident that, unless St Gregory when making them had recourse to
some compensating expedient, he either disligured his book or obliged
himself to re·write the Proprium Sanctorum at a frightful expenditure of
time, labour and parchment It had almost been better, one would
think, to leave the masses than to cancel them at such a cost Can we,
then, find traces of such a manipulation as would obviate each and all
of these altematives? We can.

Near the close of the Proprium de Tempore, and within a short
distance of the place of the first suppression, a post-pentecostal mass
which had figured in A and B is found to be wanting in the Corpus MS.;
and, within a short distance of the place of the second, the Corpus MS.

,bears witness to an elaborate manipulation which l will describe at
