mrnooucmon, xlvii

· ‘Purificet nos q. d. muneris praesentis oblatio et dignos sacra parti-
cipatione efficiat [in place oi the Veronese perficiat] per.

⁵ ‘Mentes nostras q. d. spiritus sanctus diuinis reparet [in place os
the Veronese praeparet] sacramentis, quia ipse est remissio omnium
peccatorum: per...in unitate eiusdem. [The Verona conclusion is ‘Per’
only¹.]

The correction ol the second constituent would seem to have been
allowed to wait until a late recension‚ because it was less urgently
required than that oi the other two. As a lact, and sor whatever reason,
the ‘efficiat' at iol. 5421, lin. 11 would seem to have replaced ‘perficiat'
in the course os the recension which at iol. 31, lin. 1 substituted
‘reddant' lor ‘perficiant¹.'

The tenth and eleventh instances in the present group occur, at
iol. 55 a, lin. 7 and lin. 8, in the Postcommunion sor the Friday in
Whitsunweek, a prayer which the Verona book (xvln. xxxii.) reads
thus—¹ Sumpsimus, Domine, sacri dona mysterii, humiliter deprecantes
ut quae in tui commemoratione nos lacere praecepisti in nostrae
proficiant infirmitatis auxilium. Per.'

Perhaps the first thing to arrest our attention here is the salse ending
‘Per.' Nothing is more usual in the Verona book than this conclusion
in the case os prayers addressed to the Second Person oi the Godhead;
and a strong argument in favour ol the view that previous editions to
the present one represent the textos a comparatively early recension
may, 1 think, be drawn srom the lact that such an error should have
blemished the MSS. copied by Muratori, Pamelius, Menard and Da
Rocca D'Azevedo’s is the only book which in place os ‘per dominum'
gives us a tolerable but unsupported ‘qui uiuis'; but the presence ol
‘per dominum' in the others, and the identity os this with the conclusion
in the Verona book, dispose me to think that D'Azevedo's reading may
be a post-Gregorian correction of an error which the merest scribe
would easily be forgiven ior wishing to remedy, and that ‘per dominum’
is the only authentic rival os our ‘qui cum patre'

’ Similarly, although both D'Azevedo‚ Menard and Da Rocca find ‘in
tui commemorationem‚' not ‘in tui commemoratione,’ it may well be
that their exhibition, in contrast to Pamelius, Gerbert and Muratori, of
the only tolerable form, is reserable to a post-Gregorian rectification.
But I cannot, giving mysels the benefrt ol the doubt, include this instance

in our present list. “

¹ All tbree constituents are at xl. ii ol the Verona book.
