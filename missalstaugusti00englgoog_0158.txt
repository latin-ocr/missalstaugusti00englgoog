the Pio-Clementine or the Canterbury text, shall satisfactorily explain
the seeming discrepancy?

The Psalter as used in Rome at the end ol the fourth century
was, in the opinion of St Jerotne, an inadequate representation os the
Septuagint Greek. But the revision to which he at the instance, or
with the consent, oi St Damasus, submitted it seems to have been but
coldly welcomed; indeed, it was the ill success ol that revision that
provoked him to the more painstaking and thorough labours oi his
retirement at Bethlehem. Writing to his disciples Paula and Eusto-
chium, he says,—‘ Psalterium Romae dudum positus emendaram et iuxta
lxx. interpretes, licet cursim, magna illud ex parte correxeram. Quod
quia rursum uidetis, O Paula et Eustochium, scriptorum uitio depra-
uatum, plusque antiquum errorem quam nouam emendationem ualere,
cogitis ut, ueluti quodam nouali, scissum iam aruum exerceam et obli·
quis sulcis renascentes spinas eradicem ¹.'

The mndattb of which he speaks in the first sentence would seem
to have been a castigation os grammatical forms such as a latinist might
make who had to choose between ‘introite' and ‘intrate' between ‘mag-
nificare' and ‘glorificare' between (it may even be) ‘nocere' with a
dative and the same word with an accusative, between ‘alii’ and ‘alio,’
between ‘lacus’ and ‘laci’ This castigation os archaic, ol unidiomatic
and, possibly, of ungrammatical forms seems to have been pursued lrom
end to end ol the Psalter; but it was pursued judiciously, lor he says
‘nos emendantes olim psalterium ubicunque sensus idem est ueterum
interpretum consuetudinem mutare noluimus, ne nimia nouitate lectoris
studium terreremus?

His correctio was perhaps not thoroughly prosecuted; or, if thorough.
it was not pushed srom end to end oi the document. Why the Roman
Psalter should have stood in need ol this revision, he does not tell us;
but one would suppose the reason to have been, not that it was abad
translation ol the genuine Septuagint text, but that it wasa rendering
oi the text known as κοινή. Oi this he speaks as follows in his
Epistola ad Sunniam et Fretellam,—‘aeotvvi...ista, hoc est communis
editio, ipsa est quae et Septuaginta3 sed hoc interest inter utramque,
quod κοινή pro locis et temporibus, et pro uoluntate scriptorum, uetus
corrupta editio est; ea autem quam in ἑξοπλοῖς et quam nos uertimus
ipsa est quae in eruditorum libris incorrupta et immaculata lxx. inter·
pretum translatio reseruatur¹.'
