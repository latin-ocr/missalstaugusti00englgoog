’ I now tum from primitive¹ to adventitious masses.

Ou'r Oratio for the Octeve of the Epiphany stands alone in
reading, at fol. 17, lin. 9, ‘filius unigenitus'; but the contesting ‘uni-
genitus’ is supported by Gregorian authority in the corresponding
prayer for Christmas·eve and in that for the Epiphany, and is pro·
bably the authentic reading.

In our uncancelled Preface for the Third Sunday after the Epiphany
we alone, at sol 1821, lin. 8, introduce ‘eundem' before ‘filiumtuum’ in
the phrase ‘ut hominem quem per unigenitum creaueras per eundem
filium tuum deum et hominem recreares! But, if Pamelius be right in
not placing ‘per’ before ‘unigenitum’ our ‘eundem’ is an intruder.
He reads ‘ut hominem quem unigenitum creaueras per filium tuum
deum et hominem recreares’3 and l cannot find that any editor has
(l) the first ‘per,’ (2) ‘eundem' and (3) ‘tuum' in conjunction, as found
by Gerbert, with ‘unigenitum' 1 suspect that the original has been
preserved to us by Pamelius, the ‘unigenitum’ of whose text was the
first, not the second, Adam—a view recommended by the immediate
sequel, ‘et diabolus qui Adam in fragili carne deuicerat conseruata
iustitia a Deo carne uinceretur assumpta'

And in the same mass-a mass, be it remembered, which ex hypo·
tlusi had not been of the primitive portion of the parent document of
the Corpus llis-the Secreta reads thus 2—‘Concede q. o. d, ut huius
sacrificii munus oblatum fragilitatem nostram purget ab omni malo
semper et muniat' (fol. 18v, lin. 2); whereas at fol. 2831, lin. 1, in a
mass of Gregorian compilation, the order is ‘ab omni malo purget’
This, which, undoubtedly, is the preferable sequence, is the sequence
observed on each occasion by the other editions.

Our post-Gregorian work at fol. 25 v, lin, ς is very remarkable indeed.
There, in a Thursday mass in Lent, we find ‘Gratia tua nos q. d. non

¹ True to the purpose expressed on p. xxxix 1 have confined my attention to instnneer in
which-with en oocasionnl exception, presumably editoriui. on the part of the uuthorized
Romen Miseni-the Corpus MS. stands alone as against previously published editions But,
should my view of the importance of lhe Corpus MS. be shared by scholars, they will find
abundant material for careful investigation in readings common to the Corpus lis. end some,
but only some, of the other texts.
