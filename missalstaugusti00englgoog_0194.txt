Now letustraverse five centurius of years, andnim our attentim to
the copyist.

Some of his blunders were negative, some positive If we overlook
omitted rubrics at the extreme end of a page, there remain but few of
the former; and of those few some may fairly be regarded not as
blunders, but as his own virtuous precaution against evils greater than
the neglect of a superfluous ‘dem’¹. Such of his positive faults as we
have had an opportunity of examining are those of an enthusiast
impatient of interruption rather than of a laggard too mean to think
good handicrafta virtue, and are referable to some peculiarity in the
document he was copying or to some proved diversion of thought
from one object to another’. For, true though it be that in many
cases his very familiarity with the vulgate text of the Sacramentary
may have been a subjective cooperating cause of lapse from absolute
perfectiori of workmanship, we have not as yet found reason to
believe that he would have made any positive blunders but for the
presence of some objective cause. Let us examine a few more of
them:-

At fol. 25 u, lin. 18 he omitted the word ‘salutis’ in the very
passage from which, five centuries before, St Gregory had removed the
questionable qualificative, ‘aetemae'⁸. If, then, we look about for a
direct objective cause, we have not far to seek. A text bearing traces
of the expunction of ‘ aeternae' would be the text to yield it.

At fol. 2711, lin. 5 the scribe of the Corpus MS. wrote ‘ab omnibus
nos defende periculis⁴,' where the reviscr's correction shews that-
presumably, upon collation of the passage with an authentic and
authoritative copy-the pronoun was found by him to be redundant
The most obvious explanation would be that the word ‘Nos' was in the
exemplar, that it in the exemplar was marked with expunctory dots,
but that these had been overlooked by the copyist An author’s
working copy is the proper place for authentic words marked with
expunctory dots

Now, if we suppose St Gregory to have resolved to remove ‘nos'
from the Secreta and to transform the ‘mensa caelestis’ of the next
prayer into ‘mensae caelestis libatio,' and if we further suppose him to
huve wished to displace as little text as possible, how could he best
