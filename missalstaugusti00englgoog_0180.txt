wer'e adorned with silver covers. One epistle·book was adorned with
>silver covers3 but, one being insufficient, he had asecond made, one of
whose covers was os silver, the other oi gold. Two ‘sacramentaria
altaris' were covered with silver.

Now, unlike the gospel·books and epistle·books, these two ‘sacra-
mentaria altaris’ were not duplicates the one os the other. They are
described as ‘sacramentaria altaris unum et alterum,’ not as ‘sacra-
mentaria duo.¹ They were correlative and complementary the one to
the other, as were the two covers os an epistle·book (‘ tabulae aurea una
altera uero argentea ’h The complete inventory, therefore, was as
follows:-

An old and a new epistle·book ; one ior the celebrant, the other ior ·
the subdeacon.

Two gospel-books, neither oi them new ; one ior the celebrant, the
other for the deacon.

·‹ Two distinct and correlative ‘sacramentaria altaris': both for the
priest (sacramentaria altaris unum et alterum), neither of them new.

- Had Desiderius been so minded‚ he might, one would suppose, have
appropriated the plenary missal to the celebrant while providing the
sacred ministers, one with an epistle·book, the other with a gospel·
book. But such an arrangement would not have satisfied his ideal of
the dignity proper to the altar oi such an abbey as that of Monte
Cassino. He therefore replaced it by its constituent elements‚ each in
a separate volume—an epistle·book, a gospel·book, a ‘liber sacramen·
torum' (sacramentarium unum) and a canon (sacramentarium alterum)
It is this last which, as I said just now, is to the present day used-in
a developed form-by bishops and prelates celebrating according to the
Roman rite

lt may be that the chartuhz missalis on which Alcuin wrote, or
caused to be written,a set oi votive masses ior the use oi the monks
ol Fulda¹ was an open sheet oi vellum meant in the first instance to
carry the canon oi the mass. But, even is it should be proved that
‘chartula missalis' was not a technical term with a fixed and well-
known meaning, but one invented lor the occasion by Alcuin, there is
a passage in his letter to Eanbald, Archbishop oi York, which seems to
prove that the custom of making the canon a separate document from
the book containing the variable portions oi the mass was a custom
with which he was familiar, and which he regarded as peculiarly
