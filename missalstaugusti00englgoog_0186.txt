l now abandon this provisional assumption, and, setting-down ιᾸ.
Deus cum egredereris,' Ἀ. Repleatur os meum¹ and ‘A. Karitas

dei,' as St Gregory’s three indications under the old state ol things,
acknowledge what mathematicians style an error—an error os 46 letters,
and allow that 1468 must be reduced to 1422 (= 77 x 1824).

Having said thus much, l enter on the proper subject ol the present
chapter. ,
1. Let us, then, picture to ourselves St Gregory at the moment
when he had resolved to cut out four or live leaves lrom the prototype
and introduce six or seven leaves in their place, but when he had as
yet touched neither knit'e nor pen. A twolold taslr lay belore him. He
was to reduce three ember masses to the character and dimensions ol
serial, and he was to compile three new ember masses. And the two·
sold taslr was to be so executed as that, allowance made for a blanlr
line and for a general heading to the second group—‘ IN IEIUNIO
·1111⁰'· TEMPORUM'—and, possibly, sor some little adomment at the
beginning of the post-pentecostal series of Sunday masses which were
to come next in textual order, there should be no unseemly gap and not
the slightest crowding.

ln carrying out the former portion os his task he must suppress six
prayers-one in Wednesday's mass, five in Saturday's. In carrying out
the latter, he must make provision for fifteen prayers—four as the com·
plement os one mass, three as that ol another, and eight as that ol the
third. The filteen new prayers were, with headings, antiphonarial indi-
catione, minor rubrics, a general title, and, possibly, some slight ‘waste'
in the interests ol comeliness to have the textual value os four pages os
about 370 letters each, plus that ol the six cancelled constituents and
such sew rubrics as may have belonged to them.

As to the repertory srom which he was to taire the prayers he
needed, we may reasonably suppose it to have been the ‘codex ge-
lasianus,' his own ‘liber sacramentorum’ in one ol its earlier editions,
or a document lying chronologically between the two.

ΙΙ. Now, let ustum to the Corpus MS. and note the phenomena
which call sor explanation.

First, we find that the copyist’s Oratio sor what is now the Wednes-
day serial mass (sol. 541), lin. 15)has been superseded by another, and
'that the Secreta and Postcommunion os the last ember mass (fol. 57,
lin. 16 and lin. 19) have been condemned by the principal reviset.

But, when we reflect that these three superseded prayers lay within
the limits with which St Gregory's proposed alterations had been con-
