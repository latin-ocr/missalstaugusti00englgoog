cxxiv INTRODUCTION.

St Gregory's task at the beginning ο1 the Proprium de Tempore had
been that oi a minute, caresul, complicated levelling·up to the value ol a
leal¹; in his first and second exploits on the Proprium Sanctorum it was
the very nice and exacting task os cautiously levellingdown to the
same extent; but, when he came to deal with the mass ol St Caecilia,
pursuing neither os these two methods, he simply removed the leaves
which held his masses lor St Caecilia and St Andrew, and replaced them
by others in which, nothing being given to Caecilia, so much as was
taken from her was, in the proper place, given to the apostle in the
form ol a mass lor the octave. ·

The numbers oi the suppressed mass, SETE CAECILIAE VIRGINIS, and
ol the new mass in honour ο1 St Andrew are, respectively:—

Title ar : 16
Antiphone 10 ο
Robrica 1ο i 11
Oratio 116 1²5
Secreta 112 ¹0⁵

Postcommunion 97 119

Differenceoi'l'otals 376 - 376 =o

Such, then, were the manipulations practised upon St Gregory's
Sacramentary by the illustrious editor himself alter the completion
ο1 Redaction D; ior l conclude without hesitation that he did so
manipulate it, and cannot carry scrupulosity so iar as to affront the
intelligence oi my readers by affecting to think that differences so
varied and minute and results so striking can have been fortuitous.

Thus did St Gregory lessen the bulk ο1 his Proprium Sanctorum by
the suppression ο1 two several batches ol scattered text, each ol which
represented aleas ol writing. But why? And why, when making one
mass do duty lor St Fabian and St Sebastian, and again lor St Sixtus
and SS. Felicissimus and Agapitus, fail to do the same in the case ο1
St Clement and St 'Felicitas on the twenty-third oi November? The
body oi St Sixtus did not lie beside, or even near, those ο1 Felicissimus
and Agapitus; nor the body ol Pope Fabian near that ol the soldier

saint. Why, then, the two changes? Or,if two were made, why not
a third as well?
