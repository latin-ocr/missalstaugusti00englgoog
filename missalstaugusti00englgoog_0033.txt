INTRODUCTION. xxl

1. Let us, therefore, tum to the comparatively small group of saints
who in the age of Gregory the Great were known, or believed, to lie
buried or enshrined in or near the city of Rome, and of whom it is
either certain or probable that in the age of Gregory, and in Rome
or its neighbourhood, they were honoured with the solemnities of a
public festum.

When, then, we have eliminated from our survey all masses in
honour of English saints, or saints specially honoured in England, as
Alban, Leotard, Augustine of Canterbury, and many more; of Gallican
saints, as Martin‚ Cucuphatus, Germanus, Remigius, and others; of
Spanish‚ African, German, Helvetian saints; of saints who, though
Italian, were not Roman ; it will be found that a very large majority of
the remainder are characterized by titles cast in the genitive case.
Such of them as are old enough to be Gregorian we must believe to be
governed by ‘ln festo,’ words found in the first of the list-‘ln fest[o]
sancti Siluestri papae’ Such as are post-Gregorian would seem to be
governed by ‘In natali’ This, however, is a distinction on which l
need not dwell at present.

Butos some few other Roman saints the masses bear ablative-case
headings, and it is to these that Ι would now call the attention of my
readers. Are any of them old enough to be of Gregorian redaction?

One of them, certainly, the ‘De sancta Felicitate' at fol. 133 v,
is that of a martyr whose cultus at Rome was ancient enough to have
gained her a mass at the pen of St Gregory3 nor can l find reason for
believing that the continuity of that cultus was ever broken. She is
found in the Verona book¹ commonly known as the Leonian sacramen-
tary; she is found among the Monza papyri², a fact which, at the least,
assuras us that a lamp bumt before her shrine in or shortly before the
first days of St Gregory's pontificate; aud the pontiti himself preached
one of his humilies on her feast and in her basilica’.

But on the same day as the anniversary of St Felicitas, the twenty-
second of November, fell that of St Clement‚ a saint who equally with
Felicitas must have entered into the editorial cognizance of Gregory.
His mass, however, has a genitive-case heading; and 1 account for the
difference in the obvious and only way open to me. Of two concurring
feasts the less important was, by a law familiar enough to liturgical
students‚ made to give way to the more important.

One and only one analogous case is to be found in the Roman
