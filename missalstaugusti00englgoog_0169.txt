. six, it would have been enough ior him to give the musical notation
for the first member os the quatrain, leaving it to be repeated sor
each os the other three. It was unnecessary to reiterate the musical
notation. The notation not being reiterated, the intervening words
between ‘corda' and ‘et dulciora' were, from carelessness, dropped. I am
the better pleased with this explanation, as it accounts sor the omitted
corda (D 2 5) at fol. 62. The word had been swallowed up in the lacuna.

One os the remaining instances occurs in connexion with the pas·
sage just quoted as I find it written at sol. 26 v, but not as it is at
sol. 62. ln the latter place we read ‘nam et seruus tuus custodit ea,'
and so do Pam. and Rom.; but in the former place the Pamelian
reading, like ours, is ‘custodiet'3 that ol the Roman Gradual is ‘cus-
todit.’ lt, then, it be true—as, indeed, seems likely-that St Gregory’s
readings were ‘custodit' in one place and ‘custodiet' in the other,
the differente may be reserable to divergence of texts. One os
the readings may be Roman, the other Hieronymo-Roman. They
may, at any rate, be both os them genuine. And is it be true, as I
have elsewhere suggested, that St Gregory compiled the post-pente·
costal ‹ffa'a at a different time from the others, he may on the two
several occasions have used two several copies os the psalter, copies
which he believed to have been identical, but which differed in this
passage.

The fifth and seventh are in all probability rubricators’v blunders,
blunders, it may be, as old as St Gregory¹.

It would seem, then, that the true variants in Class B are not more
than two; and it may even be that one os these,‘Iubilate De0,' is no
true variant, but merely a clerical error; though, possibly enough,
an authentic clerical error; as when in the Expositions on the
First Book ol the Kings (1. Reg. ii. 1)¹ St Gregory, quoting Ps. 97,
v. 5, says ‘Psallite Deo nostro in cithara,' and then a few lines later
on, ‘Psallite Domino in cithara' The incessant conflictos κύριος and
dede in the Greek ol passages like this, a conflict perpetuated in Latin
versions; and the confusion worse confounded which was kept up by
the frequent citing of parallel passages such as Ps. 46, v. 2, Ps. 65, v. 1,
Ps. 97, v. 4, Ps. 99, v. 2⁸, would amply account for such a lapse as ‘Deo'
ior ‘Domino’ in the second redaction. But, isso, it is a lapse corrected,

¹ For a precisely similar case to the fisth see our ‘Dum sanctificatus at t'ol. r9v., lin. 8.
Pam. agrees with us, Rom. reads ‘Cum sanctificatus?
