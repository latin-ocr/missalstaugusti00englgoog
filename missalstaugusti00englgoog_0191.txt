Thus by a stroke or two ot' the pen was created the plena hebdomada
os which Archbishop Egbert speaks.

As many copies os this seven-leaved fasciculus would be needed as
there were sair copies of Redaction D. From each oi these fair copies
the five leaves containing the Whitsun·week masses were cut bodily out,
that the fascr'czdus oi seven leaves might be inserted in place oi them.

Let me here repeat that though the Antiphonae oi the newly
inserted group oi ember masses were those which had been used under
the old arrangement, St Gregory now caused one of them to be written
‘Deus dum egredereris’ instead of ‘Deus crcm egredereris! Let me also
add that the other, instead oi being, as it seems once to have been,
‘Karitas dei diflusa est in cordibus nostris,’ was henceforth to be‘Karitas
dei diffusa est in cordibus uestrzlr’¹.

And is 1 here be asked why l think the ‘Spiritus domini repleuit
orbem terrarum . alleluia. Omnium est enim' not to have been oi the
pristine text os Redaction D, Ι reply, For iour reasons. 1. The very
length ot' the phrase would seem to declare it more or less οἱ a
stichometrical expedient². 2. The absence oi a rubricated ‘il’ suggests
it to have been a hastily penned marginal note 3. The only analogous
mass, that lor Easter·Sunday, has no antiphonarial indication. 4 If
the votive mass⁸ at fol. 146 v. may be a guide to us, ‘Omnium est enim’
are the first words of the conventional Psalm assigned to Whitsunday
in the Antiphonary which St Gregory's missionaries brought to Canter-
bury3 and we shall have to say that, unless the transcriber was untrue
to himself for the very first time⁴, his exemplar not only lacked the
necessary mbric ‘.Ps.', but made no provision forits insertion.

Vl. Now, let imagination fly irom Rome to Canterbury, from the
end of the sixth century to the early years ot' the twelt'th3 and, entering
the cloister oi St Augustine’s Abbey, Canterbury, let us look over the
shoulder oi a painstaking monk who, evidently, is engaged in revising
the textos a newly executed missal. It is a document os which we by
this time know something, MS. c.c.c.C. 270, and the painstaking monk is

² See above, p. clviii. Curionsly enough, there is in the MS. an unmistakeable unsteadiness
in the transcribens writing oi the ‘uestris’ as though he had been couseious that the word war
a new reading.

¹ See above, pp. cxvi, cxviii, cxix.

⁸ This mass is worthy oi special notice, ior its officim may fairly claim to have been taken
from the sauhugustinian Antiphonary oi St Gregory. The oorresponding officia ior Enster aud
Assensionday will be found in Appendix A.

⁴ It is worthy oi note that the same sort oi omission reeurs-at iol. ζμ, lin. 9-within the
limits affected by the changes under oonsideration.
