of August is printed in italics,-‘ 1111. Non. Ags. Romae in cimiterio
Calesti uia Appia sancti Stefani episcopi et martyris¹.'

The Verona book does, indeed, contain an entry ⁴111. Non. Augusti
Natale sancti Stephani in coemeterio Callisti uia Appia· But, even if
we surmount the initial difficulty presented by Muratori’s ‘111' and
suppose it to be a misprint for ‘1v,' the entry is a mere record of the
day and place of the burial of Pope Stephen, details which no one, so
far as l arn aware‚ has ever disputed¹. The question that conccms us is
not, Did such a person as Pope Stephen ever exist? It is, was a festum
in his honour kept in the days of Gregory the Great? So far, then, as the
Verona book can be held to answer this question, its reply is negative3
for, singularly enough, the record, so far from being followed bya mass in
commemoration of Pope Stephen, is followed by no fewer than nine, every
one of which'refates, not to him, but to his protonym, the first martyr.
And these are certainly in their proper place, for the feast of the lnven·
tion of St Stephen the Protomartyr falls, precisely, not on the fourth, but
the third, day before the Ides of August, the date given by Muratori.

Besides all this, however, there are two reasons of a more peculiar
nature against regarding the massin question as one of Gregorian redac-
tion. (1) The monks of St Augustine's have by an obelus marked the
Secreta for suppression, a liberty which 1 never find them to have taken
with unquestionable work, and (2) the word ‘episcopo' is out of keeping
with the titles of our authentic masses. In all such of them as are un-
doubtedly primitive the Roman pontifis are styled ‘papa’‚ not ‘episcopus'
Thus, ‘ln fest[0] sancti Siluestri papae’ (fol. 71v.), ‘Sancti Marcelli
papae' (fol. 74), ‘Sancti Urbani papae et martyris' (fol. 91 aa), ‘Sancti
Calixti papae et martyris' (fol. 126v.), ‘Sancti Damasi papae' (fol. 136 u).

The two remaining masses the titles of which are cast in the abla-
tive case are very interesting, and a careful discussion of them will serve
to elucidate the subject which more immediately concems us in the
present chapter, namely, the claim of the Corpus MS. to embody an
accurate transcript of a book possessing such characteristics as may be
reasonably supposed to have been proper toan authentic copy ol the
Gregorian Sacramentary. But the second of them will, 1 trust, prove
in the sequel to be of still further service to us by reason of the light it
throws on the parent document of the Corpus MS, and on the claim of
that document to textual identity with those very mass-books which we
