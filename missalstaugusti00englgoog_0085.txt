INTRODUCTION. lxxiii

of the saith, whose N ame is implied in ‘ christiana pleb3,’ and to conclude
the prayer with a ‘ Per eundem dominum! This is, precisely, what nur
book has done.

Similarly, ten lines lower down the page, it assigns the proper ending
to a prayer in which mention of the Holy Ghost is φθόῃ-ι’ per
dominum in unitate eiusdem spiritus sancti.’

The Verona book has (xxvn. iii.) the following prayer,—‘ G, s, Deus
in cuius arbitrio regnorum omnium iura consistunt protege Romani
nominis ubique rectore3,' &c Nor is our form of the Good-Friday
prayer for the Emperor, at sol. 38, lin. 6, very unlike it‚-‘O. s, d. in
cuius manu sunt omnium potestates et iura regnorum’; the subject
being enlarged from ‘ iura' to ‘ potestates et iura? But this was not the
reading of Redaction B, which must have had either ‘ omnium potestates
et omnium iura regnorum’ or, less probably, ‘omnium potestates et omnia
iura regnorum,' the· form exhibited by most of the MSS. D'Azevedo,
however, finds the repeated ‘omnium,' the reading given by the Pin-
Clementine editors; and he agrees with them in placing a comma after
‘ potestates ’—-‘ omnium potestates, et omnium iura regnorum.' If it be
conceded that ours is the best reading, and that it may have been the
reading intended by St Gregory, I would suggest that the subject of the
clause was at first ‘ iura ’-—‘ omnium iura regnorum '—and that a super-
fluous ‘omnium ⁹ crept in by clerical error on, or in consequence ns, the
addition os ‘ potestates et!

Another· instance which may, 1 think, be the correction of a mere
clerical error occurS‚ at fol. 38, lin. 14, in the Good-Friday ‘ oremus* for
the catechumen8‚ where we read ‘ ut et ipsi digni inueniantur’ as against
all previous editions, none os which have ‘et ipsi digni‚' the majority
omitting ‘ digni.’ Tommasi, however, finds ‘ digni,’ but no ⁸ et ip5i‚' in the
so-called Gelasian sacramentary; and Gerbert records an instance uf it
in one or other os his texts The account 1 would offer is that 'digni'
was the prae-Gregorian reading3 that it was St Gregory’s intention tn
prefix ‘ et ipsi ² to the word, in analogy with the ‘ pro his quoqu-s:1 of the
paschal and pentecostal ‘Hanc igitur-'3 but that the copyist of Reti-action
B, misled, perhaps, by the textual equivalence of the two thing5‚ substi-
tuted in place of prefixing, and that his error was corrected at the
textual revision represented by the books sent to Canterbury¹.

² The most cursory inspection os the Verona book as edited by the brothers Banefini suffices
to prove that words, or groups os words, regarded by them—so it would seem-as alternative
readings stand side by side in the document, as though meant to be equally part and pamel uf
the text. Not infrequently readings occur which the editors take sor variants: hut which,
