vi PREFACE.

Nor can Ι overlook my obligation to the staff oi the University Press
and their able compositors. No pains have been spared to alleviate the
very trying task oi passing a work like the present through the precs
with as near an approach to absolute accuracy as might be. Mr Alfred
Rogers, of the University Library, will allow me to say how 'materially
my labours have been lessened by his careiul and conscientious collation
oi my proni-sheets with the MS.

Pleasure and pain are strangely mingled as 1 review the last ten
years. I could wish that ,Henry Bradshaw were here to pronounce a
just but kindly judgment on my endeavours. One of the last acts,
perhaps the last completed act, os his lise had been to give his impri-
matur to an earlier monograph oi mine in some respecta similar to the
present I could wish that Giovanni Battista de Rossi were here to
forgive my briei invasion of a domain which he has made sor ever his

Ι own. He, too, has passed away3 and so has his not unworthy disciple,

Mariano Armellini. The news reaches me as 1 write these lines. But
the grief that lies nearest to my heart is that I arn bereaved of my friend
Samuel Savage Lewis. 1 cannot say how much 1 owe to him; but, is
he be cognizant oi what is passing here, he knows that 1 am not un-
mindsul of his love.
