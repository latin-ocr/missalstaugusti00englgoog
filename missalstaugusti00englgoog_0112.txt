C INTRODUCTioN.

[Felix,] Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix, where the reading ‘affectu'
of the Corpus MS. is unquestionably wrong, as against the ‘effectu’
of the Verona book (XXXV. ii), a reading shared by previous editions
of the Gregorian Sacramentary. Here, too, the variant occurs in an
Oratio, as if to warn us that the compilation in which it occurs had
not been edited by St Gregory. Nor, indeed, do l find anything
that can raise the very slightest presumption that St Gregory knew
anything ofa feast of SS. Simplicius Faustinus and Beatrix. Their
very names are absent from the Bucherian indiculus, from the Verona
book, from the Monza papyri, and from St Gregory’s homilies. They
do, indeed, occur in the ‘De locis sanctis¹,' but they occur there, as do
those of many other saints who had no festum, without any intimation
that either church or oratory had been erected in their honour. The
‘Notitia ecclesiarum' makes no mention of them, nor does the
Malmesbury itinerary; and, unless l have formed a very false estimare
of these two documents, their silence is conclusive against the existence
of a festum of the saints in question at as late a date, at the earliest,
as the middle of the seventh century, and so long as they lay buried near
the Via Portuensis. The Liber Pontificalis (§ 149) on the other hand,
says of Pope Leo ll. (nl). 683, 684):-‘Hic fecit ecclesiam in urbe Roma
iuxta sanctam Bibianam, ubi et corpora sanctorum Simplicii Faustini et
Beatricis atque aliorum recondidit, et ad nornen beati Pauli apostoli
dedicauit! One would suppose it, therefore, to have been on occasion of
this reconditio by Leo 11. that the present mass was added to the Roman
sacramentary. And, if this be so, our corrupt ‘affectu' is but another
proof out of many that some at least of the adventitious contents of the
Canterbury book reached our shores after a broken journey, and that
they had been made to suffer in the course of transit

Leo ΙΙ. died in the year 684, and was followed by three successive
popes whose pontificates barely covered as many winters. Then came
Sergius Ι. (al). 687-701), one of whose most celebrated acts was the
translation, in the year 688, and on the twenty-eighth of June, of the
body of the first Leo from a too obscure testing-place to a tomb in the
Vatican basilica But, curiously enough, this translation of Leo the
Great was effected on, precisely, the fourth anniversary of the second
Leo. Although, therefore, the Roman Chureh at the present moment
honours Leo ll. on the twenty-eighthof June, it by no means follows that
it was he and not his great predecessor to whom we are to refer our
mass ‘Sancti Leonis papae,’ on fol. 9711, immediately before that for
